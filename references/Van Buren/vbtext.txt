{c16711680}I fixed the computer, but it can only be used to store and retrieve information. 
{c16711680}I have some raw data here from a supercomputer named Zax. Can you use the Ritual to process it?

{c16711680}The Vipers are gone. Can you do the Ritual now?
{c255}You are an outsider, and therefore have great potential to disrupt the Counter's carefully calculated harmony of our village.

{c16711680}Me counter, too. One, two... uh, five. See?
{c16711680}Uh-huh. What job you do here?
{c255}As I said, I am the Nemonik. A foreign word to you, perhaps? It means... "memory keeper". In other times, I lead the Ritual.
{c255}I am a teacher. Well, I am more than that, but I am afraid that you would probably not understand.
{c16711680}You mentioned the Counter. Who's that?
{c16711680}You say somebody counting me? Who?
{c16711680}What's the Ritual?
{c16711680}What do you teach?
{c16711680}What you teach?
{c255}Our Counter is Azkee. It is his responsibility to ensure that Mesa Verde can survive, and thus it is his responsibility to factor in all variables which can affect the village.
{c255}No, no. Our leader is called the Counter. He makes sure the village runs smoothly, a task I fear will be complicated by your presence.
{c16711680}I see. So, what do you do here?
{c255}It is a special ceremony for times when we a presented with a problem too great for one mind alone to solve. By acting as one, we Ciphers can solve any mathematical dilemma. 
{c16711680}How is that possible?
{c16711680}You're saying that all the Ciphers together can act like a computer?
{c16711680}I have some raw data here from a supercomputer named Zax. Could you use the Ritual to process it?
{c255}Yes. The Ritual became necessary after the computer of our ancestors failed. Unfortunately, the Ritual is not a complete replacement for the computer.
{c16711680}What do you mean?
{c255}You see the schematics on the walls around you? Our ancestors carved them on the walls after the computer failed, but time and the weather have not been kind to them. Our Ritual cannot save them.
{c16711680}Why don't you just repair the computer and store the schematics in there?
{c255}Our ancestors did not possess the knowledge to do those repairs, and, unfortunately, neither do we.
{c16711680}Where's the computer now? I might be able to fix it.
{c16711680}I could fix the computer, for a price.
{c255}In the storage cave, at the north end of the village. I fear that it may have been scavenged for spare parts, though, making its repair even more difficult.
{c16711680}All right, I'll go have a look at it.
{c16711680}I didn't say I was going to do it for {i}free{}. I expect payment for my services.
{c255}Not at this time. The Ritual requires all Ciphers to fall into a meditative trance, and it is too risky to do this while the Vipers continue to harass us.
{c255}I shall gladly call together a Ritual for you. Do you wish this done now?
{c16711680}Yes, let's do it.
{c16711680}All right, I'll go deal with the Vipers first.
{c16711680}Who are the Vipers, and what do they want?
{c255}Storage is all we need it for. Thank you, outsider.
{c16711680}And my payment?
{c16711680}Goodbye. 
{c255}Servants of a madwoman who claims she controls the fertility of all the tribes. We refused to allow one of her Daughters to live her, and she sends her Vipers as punishment.
{c16711680}All right. I'll go take care of them.
{c255}Of course. Here is the medicine as I promised.
{c255}Of course. Mesa Verde is by no means a rich village, but I can give you medicines from my personal supply if you restore the computer for us. Will this be sufficient compensation?I trained with Teacher to learn the Hangdog fighting style.Hangdogs teach me how they fight. I fight like dog now."Let me take to the bitches, I'll be right back."
{c16711680}It'll do.

They're a lot bigger than normal, and Azkee is afraid that this is not a good thing. He wants me to investigate the matter.I agreed to figure out what's going on with Mesa Verde's giant crops for Azkee.It seems that the miracle fertilizer that Denom bought is responsible for the giant crops. Unfortunately, the fertilizer is radioactive, which means that any crops grown in Mesa Verde's fields are unhealthy to eat.Arrange for food to be shipped to Mesa Verde from Hoover Dam.Without any cropfields to support the village, Azkee will have to start banishing people from Mesa Verde.I asked Azkee about having food shipped to Mesa Verde, but he said that the Ciphers couldn't afford the cost.I said that I would cover the cost of having food shipped to Mesa Verde, and Azkee took me up on my offer.I arranged to have food shipped to Mesa Verde.I agreed to figure out what's going on with Mesa Verde's giant crops for Azkee, and he's going to give me an old revolver for my time.Rescue the captured Ciphers.A group of slavers posing as the food caravan from Hoover Dam captured a number of Ciphers.I've agreed to help track down the slavers and rescue the captured Ciphers.ClearAdd"I hope someone fixes that darn generator soon!""I saw smoke coming from the generator room earlier.""Boy is it dark in here!""Gosh, it's hot in here!""One of those insti-meals sure sound good right about now.""Thank goodness everything is fixed!""I'm so glad everything is working again!""The sooner we can get life support up and running, the better."I've agreed to help locate and rescue the kidnapped Ciphers.

{c16711680}What if I want to call you Sally?
{c16711680}Me call you Sally. 
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}What can I do for you?
{c16711680}Me ask questions about town?
{c16711680}Tell me about the extermination job again.
{c16711680}Me want to know about bug-killing job again.
{c16711680}I exterminated all the vermin.
{c16711680}Me killed all bugs and rats.
{c16711680}Tell me about the escaped worker again.
{c16711680}Me want to know about guy who run away again.
{c16711680}Delivering Ivan, as promised.
{c16711680}Me brought Ivan.
{c16711680}It's done. Jeremiah is dead.
{c16711680}Me killed Jeremiah.
{c16711680}I've brought a peace offer from Jeremiah. He'll stop his attacks, and he wants the Mormons to live peacefully in Jericho.
{c16711680}Marmets not attack caravans any more. They want to live here and be happy.
{c16711680}The Mormons are getting ready to attack, and they've sworn to put all you sinners in the ground. We'd better attack them first. I can help, but I'll need the help of your best men.
{c16711680}Marmets coming to kill everybody! Me kill them first, but me need help!
{c255}Shoot.
{c255}Right now, Anson's is the only place in town for booze, entertainment, and women. He's got a real knack for importing in the pretty ladies, too. If you need patching up, see Lane, but I think a dead brahmin is more of a doctor than "Doc" Lane.
{c255}Well, to the southeast there's Burham Springs, where we get the coal for the plant ? bad place, don't go there if you can help it. A bit further that way is Ouroborous, home to some crazy tribals. I wouldn't go there, either.
{c255}Well, we have a working salt water desalination plant, so we can export water in exchange for other supplies. We've also got our salicornia fields for food. The taste takes some getting used to, though.
{c16711680}What's there to do around here?
{c16711680}What stuff to do?
{c16711680}Any places of interest near Jericho?
{c16711680}What places near here?
{c16711680}How does this town survive all the way out here?
{c16711680}This place far away from other places? How you not die?
{c16711680}Never mind. Do you have any work for me?
{c16711680}No more questions. Me need money now.
{c255}Do you also want a bullet between your eyes?
{c255}You're not too bright, so I'll let that pass... this time. Don't call me Sally ever again.
{c16711680}Not really. Can I ask you a few questions instead?
{c16711680}Okay. Me ask questions?
{c16711680}Ooooh, is Sally getting angry?
{c16711680}Me think Sally funny name for man. Hi, Sally!
{c255}I might, but first you ought to now that all payments are non-negotiable. Now, are you any good in a fight?
{c255}Ha! Doesn't everybody? I'm guessing you're asking me for work. Well, just so you know, I don't bargain when it comes to payments. Now, are you any good in a fight?
{c16711680}I can handle myself. What's the job?
{c16711680}Me fight good. What me do?
{c16711680}Not really. Can I ask you some questions instead?
{c16711680}Me crappy fighter. Me ask you questions, okay?
{c255}We've got several kinds of vermin around here which are starting to make real nuisances of themselves: rats, cockroaches, and wasps. Wipe 'em out, and you get 100 caps.
{c16711680}I'll do it. Where do I need to go?
{c16711680}Okay. Me do it. Where me go?
{c255}To the west of town is the old Union Train station ? the wasps have a nest in there. In the northeast section of town, there are a couple of old, burnt-out buildings housing some huge cockroaches. As for the rats, I'm pretty sure they're coming out of the sewers in the east side of town.
{c16711680}Before I go, can I ask you some questions?
{c16711680}Me ask questions before me go?
{c16711680}All right. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Me do job. Goodbye.
{c255}Nicely done. Here's your money. You up for some more work?
{c16711680}Sure.
{c16711680}Yup.
{c255}One of the plant workers, Ivan, decided he'd rather be on the run rather than serve out his sentence in the plant. Find him, bring him back alive, and I'll pay you 500 caps. Talk to Caulwell over at the plant for more details.
{c16711680}All right, I'll track him down and bring him back.
{c16711680}Okay. Me go find him.
{c255}Very nice work ? here's your payment. Deputy, take Ivan and hang him.
{c16711680}What? You didn't say anything about executing him!
{c16711680}Why you wanna kill him?
{c16711680}Is there anything else for me to do?
{c16711680}Me do something else?
{c-16777216}
{c255}Well, I'll take your word for it, but the bounty was only good for a live man.
{c255}You didn't misunderstand me and kill him, did you? In any case, the bounty was only good for a live man.
{c16711680}I understand. Got anything else for me?
{c16711680}Okay. More to do?
{c16711680}I'll just {b}take {}my money from your corpse, then.
{c16711680}Me kill you and take money.
{c255}Ivan was justly sentenced, and instead of serving out that sentence, he chose to escape. I won't have that kind of behavior in Jericho. Deputy, you have your orders.
{c16711680}Ivan only escaped because he was afraid the air in the plant would kill him. He'll gladly serve out his sentence, but he all wants is to be moved to a cleaner job.
{c16711680}Ugh, not kill. He, uh, he nice man! 
{c16711680}I understand. Is there anything else you need me to do?
{c16711680}Oh, okay. You need me to do more?
{c255}Hmmm... I see your point. All right, I'll move Ivan over to the salicornia farm, {i}but {}he gets an extra six months added onto his sentence for his little vacation away from Jericho.
{c16711680}That sounds fair. Now, is there anything else you need me to do?
{c255}Sorry, but Jericho's a law-abiding town, and our law says that any convict who runs from his sentence gets marked for death. Deputy, take Ivan away.
{c255}You're not smart enough to understand what's at stake here, so this discussion is over. Deputy, take Ivan away.
{c16711680}All right. I don't suppose you have any more jobs for me?
{c16711680}Me want more work.
{c255}Our caravans are being attacked by a group of Mormons calling themselves the Hands of God. I've decided it's time to end their interference for good, but there are complications.
{c16711680}What kind of complications?
{c16711680}What that mean?
{c16711680}I'll consider it. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Me think about it. Goodbye.
{c255}The Mormon camp, which is east of here, has women and children in it. I've got good men working for me, but they're trigger-happy. I'm sending you in the hope that they're won't be a bloodbath.
{c16711680}I see. So, what exactly did you want me to do?
{c16711680}Oh. What me do?
{c255}Jeremiah is their leader. Kill him without harming any of the women or children, if you can manage it. This job's worth 1000 caps if you pull it off.
{c16711680}I'll do it.
{c16711680}Me do it.
{c255}Excellent{i} {}work. Here's the money I promised you, and with that, I believe our business together is concluded.
{c255}Let me get this straight ? Jeremiah tries to force us out of our own town, burns our caravans when we refuse, and now he expects to live {i}with {}us in peace? What's the catch?
{c16711680}No catch, sheriff. Jeremiah was just a little overzealous in interpreting God's will, and now he just wants peace. 
{c16711680}Not catch anything. Marmet guy say he sorry and want to be nice to everybody now.
{c255}Well, nobody died, so I {i}suppose{} I could forgive those idiots for burning three perfectly good wagons. All right, tell them we have a deal. Oh, and one more thing.
{c16711680}Yes?
{c16711680}What that?
{c255}Nice job. Here's your pay... with a bonus. You've done good today.
{c255}Dammit! I'd hoped it wouldn't come to this, but now it looks like we've got no choice. I'll get the boys and meet you at the camp.
{c255}I wasn't born yesterday you know. What, you get some kind of kick out of trying to cause trouble? Get the hell out of my sight before I have you strung up!
{c255}You know, the Mormons didn't seem very well-armed for a group that was going to attack Jericho.
{c16711680}What does it matter? Your troubles with them are over, and I want my money.
{c16711680}Well, me stupid and not know anything. Job done. Gimme money!
{c255}Yeah, here's your money. Now, get out of here. I don't want to see your face for awhile.
{c255}You've done a fine thing for Jericho, and I think it's only fair for you to share in our prosperity. I'm giving you a 5 percent stake in the water plant, whether you like it or not.
{c16711680}And that means?
{c255}It means that you share in the profits. You can pick up your share at the first of every month. Here's a little advance ? 1500 caps. There's a lot more where that came from, too.
{c255}I heard about the deal you cut with Hoover Dam ? guns and armor, huh? Well done, even though you had no authority to negotiate on Jericho's behalf.
{c255}I heard about the deal you cut with Hoover Dam ? guns and action figures? Nice job on the guns, but what the hell are we going to do with dolls, dammit?
{c16711680}They're not {i}dolls, {}they're {i}action figures{}. 
{c255}I heard about the deal you cut with Hoover Dam ? armor and action figures? We could use better armor, but what the hell are we going to do with dolls, dammit?
{c255}You gave Hoover Dam a price cut in exchange for these dolls? You had no right to negotiate a contract with them! What were you thinking?
{c255}What? Never mind! You're crazy, you know that?"This job officially sucks.""Could really use a break right about now."" pump!""At least I didn't get hung.""Somebody should stick a knife in O'Connor.""Man, so many more days to go...""Did you see Anson's new girl?

{c255}Hello there! I've been looking for someone to talk to about the water plant, but it doesn't seem anyone is around at the moment. 
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}I can't wait here forever, you know. And, *ahem*, I believe we have already "donated" something to your pockets?
{c255}Hello again! So, are you ready to make a deal with us?
{c16711680}All right, let's deal. What is Hoover Dam offering in exchange for a lower rate on its water imports?
{c255}Oh, sorry about that. I'm Krieger, Simon Krieger. My associates and I have come all the way from Hoover Dam to talk to someone about the water plant.
{c16711680}Well, I have a 5 percent stake in the plant. Can you talk to me?
{c16711680}What's your interest in the plant?
{c255}Oh, I'm afraid I can't discuss that with anyone who doesn't have a stake in the plant. Let's just say I've got a deal which could be quite lucrative for everyone involved.
{c16711680}I've got a 5 percent stake in the plant. Can you talk to me?
{c255}Good enough for me! Well, word has gotten around that Jericho's water plant is pumping out lot more fresh water these days. We at Hoover Dam could use some of that extra water... at a more reasonable price.
{c16711680}So, you'd like to work out some sort of low-rate contract?
{c16711680}What's in it for me?
{c16711680}Doesn't Jericho already ship water to Hoover Dam?
{c255}Yes, a long-term one. In exchange for lower rates on Jericho's water ? say, a 15 percent reduction, Hoover Dam is prepared to offer Jericho {i}exclusive {}access to any one of our fine exports.

{c16711680}What happened? How did I get here?
{c16711680}Do you know how to use all that gear or is it just for show?
{c16711680}Nothing right now. Let's go.
{c255}Corporal Armstrong of the 4th Armored Infantry Division, Great Midwest Commonwealth. I'll help you reach your vault, citizen.
{c16711680}Okay. Let's go.
{c255}We need to find your vault entrance, but first we have to get through this bombed out city. There may be Communist insurgents taking advantage of the bombing raid, so be alert, citizen!
{c255}Your Communist parents didn't believe the government's bombing raid sirens and were reduced to ash. You made your way to the relocation center and I offered to escort you here. It should only be a block or two.

{c255}Well, here's the entrance to the vault, citizen. I have to head back to the City now. This T-45d eats up small energy cells like Chans at a rice buffet! Ha, ha, ha! Don't worry, though. We'll send those godless reds packing within the month!

{c16711680}Nice to meet you, too. Who are you?
{c16711680}Guh?
{c16711680}Goodbye.Thanks to the Cipher Ritual, you were able to process Zax's data.I learned from the Nemonik that the Ciphers have a Ritual which allows the whole village to act like one big human computer. Weird.
{c255}Speak, outsider.
{c255}Hello again, my friend. What may I do for you?Thanks to the Cipher Ritual, you were able to process Zax's data.
{c16711680}What do you do here?
{c16711680}What you do here?
{c16711680}Anything going on that I could help with?Thanks to the Cipher Ritual, you were able to process Zax's data.
{c16711680}Me help with something?
{c16711680}Didn't you mention something about Vipers harassing Mesa Verde?
{c16711680}You say people bugging village?
{c16711680}I've removed the Viper threat.
{c16711680}Bad guys all gone.
{c16711680}What was that you said about the crops?
{c16711680}You say you not like crops?
{c16711680}The new fertilizer Denom used on the crops was radioactive, which is why the crops are so big. It's probably not a good idea to eat anything grown from those fields.
{c16711680}Fertilizer make crops all glowy and mutated. Not good to eat.
{c16711680}Is there anything that can help Mesa Verde's food supply?
{c16711680}What you do about food?
{c16711680}I arranged for a Hoover Dam caravan to bring you food.
{c16711680}Men with moo-cows bring you food now.
{c16711680}Tell me again about what happened to your people.
{c16711680}Where your people go, again?
{c16711680}I was able to rescue all of your people.
{c16711680}Me save all you people. Nobody die.
{c16711680}I managed to rescue your people, but not all of them survived the escape.
{c16711680}Me save people, but not all still alive.
{c16711680}I found your people, but none of them survived the escape.
{c16711680}Me find people, but they all die.
{c255}I'm Azkee, Counter for this village.
{c255}*sigh* I'm Azkee, Counter for this village. Please, don't touch anything.
{c16711680}What do you count?
{c16711680}What you counting?
{c255}The Ciphers you see around you are not all the Ciphers there are. Most are nomads, travelers in the wasteland. It is the Counter's duty to decide who may stay in Mesa Verde, and who must leave.
{c16711680}What kind of variables?
{c16711680}Uh, okay. What that mean?
{c255}Population, for one. Mesa Verde can only support a small number of my people and it is my duty as the Counter to enforce population control.
{c255}It means I decide who gets to live here, and who must leave.
{c16711680}I see. So, is there anything you could use some help with?
{c16711680}Oh. Me help you with something?
{c255}Yes. The Vipers in the canyon disturb my village, but we are at an impasse ? neither side can defeat the other. Perhaps the help of an outsider like yourself can tip the balance in our favor.
{c16711680}I'll solve your Viper problem for you. Somehow.
{c16711680}Me go move Vipers for you.
{c16711680}Those guys? I already took care of them.
{c16711680}Me already take care of Vipers.
{c16711680}What's in it for me if I help you?
{c16711680}You gimme stuff for me help?
{c255}We have a small surplus of bullets and chems which are yours if you do what I ask.
{c16711680}All right. I'll go take care of the Vipers.
{c16711680}Me go move Vipers now.
{c16711680}Well, hand them over. I already took care of the Vipers.
{c16711680}Gimme! Me already take care of Vipers.
{c255}I wish you luck, outsider.
{c255}Thank you, outsider. You didn't ask for a reward, but I must offer you some compensation for your efforts.

{c255}Thank you, outsider. Here are the bullets and chems I promised.
{c16711680}Is there anything else you need help with?
{c16711680}Me help you more?
{c255}It's been brought to my attention that the crops are unusually large this season. I'd like you to investigate this matter for me.
{c16711680}All right. Who do I need to talk to?
{c16711680}Okay. Who me talk to?
{c16711680}What's the pay?
{c16711680}Me want money.
{c255}If you can find out what has happened to the crops, I'll give you this revolver. It's old, but functional.
{c16711680}Deal. Who do I need to talk to?
{c255}See Denom at the top of the mesa. He's the one in charge of the fields and the wind turbine.
{c255}This is very bad. Without the crops, we must rely entirely on hunting, and hunting alone cannot support the village at its current size. I will be forced to banish people into the wasteland. Oh, and here is the revolver I promised.
{c16711680}What if you had more food brought to you?
{c16711680}You get food from other place, maybe?
{c255}A caravan from Hoover Dam would be the best source for food, but I'm afraid the cost for the shipments would be very high. We can't afford it.
{c16711680}I'll cover the cost.
{c16711680}Me pay for everything.
{c255}You're being generous. I'm surprised, considering that you insisted on payment for my other tasks. Still, I gladly accept your offer.
{c255}I welcome your generosity, . If you do this for us, you shall always find a place here at Mesa Verde.
{c16711680}It's a loan, not a gift. I expect you to pay me back one of these days ? with interest.
{c16711680}It loan. Me want money back someday.
{c255}Oh. Still, it is the best we can do right now, and I still accept your offer.
{c255}Thank you, ! Your generosity has allowed many Ciphers too old or too young to travel to remain within the village.

{c16711680}Me kill them.
{c16711680}I snuck past them. So, can I come inside now?
{c16711680}Me sneaky. Um, you in me way. Move.
{c16711680}I flew over them, of course. It's the only way to travel.
{c255}You... you did? Well, uh, I guess you can come into the village, then.
{c255}Uh, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to let you inside.
{c16711680}You're the only guard I see, and you don't {i}know {}if you can let me inside?
{c16711680}Me not understand.
{c16711680}Let me in right {b}now {}or I'll take that crappy rifle of yours and shove it so far up your ass you'll be tasting gunpowder for weeks.
{c16711680}Me go in {b}now{} or me tear you arm off and beat you!
{c255}*gulp* Go right in, sir.
{c255}*gulp* Go right in, ma'am.
{c255}Ha! If {i}that's{} as scary as you can get, then I suppose I could handle you if you make trouble. Go on in.
{c255}Oh. You'd have to talk to Trig about that.
{c16711680}All right, I will. So, are you going to let me in or what?
{c16711680}Okay. Um, you still in me way.
{c255}Look, I may be young, but I'm not stupid. I know outsiders can't fly. Um, you can't... right?
{c16711680}Yes, I was joking. Actually, I'm exploring. Are you going to let me in your village?
{c16711680}I'm a mutant. All mutants fly. Therefore, I can fly.
{c255}I'm new! I was only told to watch out for the Vipers. Nobody ever said anything about other visitors.
{c255}It's just that... over, never mind. You can come in.
{c16711680}Well, let me talk with your leader. If he doesn't like me, he can have you throw me out. How's that sound?
{c255}Wow! Can I see?
{c16711680}Not right now. Are you going to let me in, or do I, uh, need to fly over you?
{c255}You're just making fun of me 'cause you think I'm still a kid.
{c16711680}Sorry. Now, are you going to let in or what?
{c255}Yeah, sure. You have to come back and show me how you can fly, okay?
{c255}I guess that'll be okay. You can come in.I overheard one of the Hangdog girls talking about wanting to be a dog trainer.Hangdog girl say she want to train dogs.Grins A Lot's daughter Marie wants to learn to train the dogs, but Hangdog girls are expected to take care of the home.Marie wants to work with dogs. Grins is her father. She can't work with dogs because she is a girl and Hangdogs no allow it.
{c16711680}Me help.
{c16711680}This has nothing to do with me.
{c16711680}Too bad. Not problem for me.
{c255}We are not your people, but I know you must be familiar with many places in the wasteland. We desperately need your help.
{c16711680}Oh, all right. I'll help you.
{c16711680}Okay, me help.
{c16711680}You still owe me for the food caravans. Until then, I'm not lifting a finger to help you.
{c16711680}Me not get paid yet for food. Me not help you.
{c255}Thank you. The slavers were spotted heading to the northwest of Mesa Verde. Good luck, and may the numbers come up in your favor, ."Look what the wastes brought in.

[The cannon needs new capacitors].Find out what's wrong with Trig's death cannon.Trig has built some sort of laser death cannon to use on the Vipers, but it doesn't work.I inspected Trig's death cannon, and found out that the capacitors she used are defective. This is what's preventing the cannon from firing.Trig said I might be able to find another set of capacitors at Fort Abandon.I helped Trig replace the capacitors on her death cannon, and we fired it at the Vipers. The results were extremely impressive. Unfortunately, Trig's cannon was completely fried in the process.Tried to tell Trig why gun thingie broken. She not understand. Maybe if me find parts and show her, she understand better.Gun thingie fixed. We shoot snake guys and they scream and turn black. Fun!
{c255}I'd love to talk, but I'm a little busy at the moment.
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Arrrgh! Stupid piece of junk! Why aren't you {i}working{}?
{c255}Hi there. What's new?
{c16711680}Show me what you have for sale.
{c16711680}Me buy things.
{c16711680}What do you do here, Trig?
{c16711680}What you do here?
{c16711680}What are you working on?
{c16711680}What you doing?
{c16711680}Your laser cannon needs a new set of capacitors. The ones you have installed {i}look {}okay, but they're immediately discharging any energy the cells pour into them.
{c16711680}Big gun thingie need new... uh... thingie. [You do your best to describe what's wrong with the cannon.]
{c16711680}I fixed your laser cannon. It just needed a new set of capacitors. So, can we shoot something, or {i}someone{}, with it now?
{c16711680}Me fix gun thingie. It need new, uh, thingies. Me wanna shoot stuff!
{c16711680}I'd like to buy your inventions.
{c16711680}Me buy those things you made.
{c16711680}I have the money for your inventions.
{c16711680}Me not poor anymore. Me buy things you made.
{c16711680}You wouldn't happen to know how to build a docking clamp, would you?
{c16711680}Me need clamp thingie built. You know how?
{c255}I'm Trig, and... damn it, {i}why {}isn't this stupid thing working?
{c16711680}What job you do here?
{c16711680}What's that thing near the cliff? Some sort of weapon?
{c16711680}What big thingie by cliff?
{c255}Trying to rig an electronic sound alarm for the village ? you know, to warn us when people are coming up the path.
{c16711680}Oh, I see. Show me what you have for sale.
{c16711680}Oh. Me buy things.
{c16711680}Interesting. What else do you do around here?
{c16711680}Uh, okay. What more you do here?
{c16711680}I know something about electronics. Mind if I take a look?
{c16711680}Me know that stuff. Gimme.
{c16711680}You don't anything that fancy. I'll show you how to make a simple alarm using materials found in the wild.
{c16711680}That no good. Me show you how to build noisy thing with sticks and stuff.
{c255}Well, normally I don't trust anything that doesn't run off a battery, but I guess it'll have to do. Show me.
{c16711680}[You show her how to build a primitive but effective alarm.]
{c255}Well, I guess it'll do for now. Thanks!
{c16711680}No problem. Show me what you have for sale.
{c16711680}Yup! Me buy things now.
{c255}Go ahead. I'm ready to throw the damn thing over the cliff.
{c16711680}Hmmm... trying connecting that wire {i}here {}and this wire over {i}there{}. Okay, that should do it. [The alarm starts shrieking.]
{c16711680}Um... that go {i}here{}, that go {i}there{}. Okay, maybe it work now. [The alarm starts shrieking.]
{c255}Hey, thanks! With this, it'll be impossible for anyone to sneak up on the village.
{c16711680}That looks like some sort of cannon at the edge of the cliff.
{c16711680}What big gun thingie over there?
{c255}Well, it's {i}supposed {}to be a high-yield laser cannon, but right now it's just a useless piece of junk.
{c16711680}Who did you want to shoot?
{c16711680}You shoot somebody?
{c16711680}What's wrong with it?
{c16711680}Why it not work?
{c255}Those damn Vipers who are keeping us bottled up in the village. The cannon has got a clear shot at them. Now, if I can just get it working...
{c255}Well, I really wanted to shoot those Vipers with it, but they're gone now, so I'm going to take it down and use the parts in something else. The cannon never worked, anyway.
{c16711680}What's wrong with the cannon?
{c16711680}Why gun thingie broken?
{c255}Go ahead, but be really, {i}really {}careful with it. Most of the parts I used to make it are just about impossible to find.
{c-16777216}
{c255}Oh, I fix broken electronics people bring in and trade them for other things. I also try to invent new electronics whenever I have the parts.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Do you have anything to trade now?
{c16711680}Me can buy things now?
{c16711680}So, what have you invented?
{c16711680}What you make?
{c255}Here, I'll show you what I have available.
{c-16777216}
{c255}I've only managed to make two things which work ? sort of. One's a device which scares away animals for some reason ? dogs in particular. I was trying to build an alert system for the village.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}And the other one?
{c16711680}That not two. One plus one equal... two. What number two?
{c255}The other invention is this low-powered laser pointer. All it does is shoot a red beam at whatever you point it at, and that's it. It was {i}supposed {}to be a miniature death ray.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Are you willing to sell either of them?
{c16711680}Me buy them!
{c255}Everytime I try to fire it, it ends up draining the fusion cells without doing a damn thing. I'm not sure how to fix the problem.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Mind if I take a look at it?
{c16711680}Me go look at it.
{c255}You actually want to {i}buy {}them? Well, it's your money. 100 caps for both of them.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Done.
{c16711680}Okay.
{c16711680}That's pretty pricey for a couple of inventions which don't do what they're supposed to. 75 caps is much more fair.
{c16711680}Nuh-uh! They not work, so me give you... um... uh... not 100.
{c16711680}Sorry, I don't have the cash on me right now.
{c16711680}Ugh. Me too poor. Can't buy.
{c255}Well, I doubt anyone else wants them, so come talk to me again when you get the money.
{c-16777216}
{c255}All right, 75 it is.
{c-16777216}
{c255}*sigh* All right, not 100. How about 75?
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Deal.
{c16711680}Damn, I just realized I don't have the money.
{c16711680}Eek! Me too poor! Can't buy.
{c255}Damn. I'm out of capacitors. However, there's a place a little west of here called Fort Abandon where I trade for parts once in awhile. Maybe you can find those there.
{c-16777216}
{c255}I'm really sorry, but I don't understand what you mean. 
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Lucky for you, I happen to have a spare set of capacitors on me.
{c16711680}Gah! It need these thingies! [Show her the spare capacitors you have.]
{c16711680}Thanks for the information. Goodbye
{c16711680}Ugh. Goodbye.
{c255}Lucky me, indeed. Come on, let's hurry up and install those things. Those Vipers are going to be in for {i}such {}a surprise.
{c-16777216}
{c255}Oh, {i}those{}. Why didn't you just show them to me in the first place? Come on, let's hurry and up and install those things. We've got some Vipers to toast.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Let's do it.
{c16711680}Yeah, yeah!
{c16711680}Hold on. I'm not just {i}giving {}these to you. I'd like some payment first, please.
{c16711680}Hey, these not free! Gimme money!
{c255}Okay. So, what if trade you a geiger counter and an infrared helmet for them? Would that be good enough for you?
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Sounds good. Let's get these capacitors installed.
{c16711680}Yeah, me like. We go fix gun thingie now.
{c16711680}No, sorry. That's not good enough.
{c16711680}Nope. Gimme more.
{c255}That's all the items I can spare. If we can't make a deal, then I guess I'll have to find those capacitors somewhere else.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}All right, fine. We have a deal. Let's get these capacitors installed.
{c16711680}Okey-dokey. Me take stuff. Now we go fix gun thingie.
{c16711680}I guess so. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Me keep gun thingies parts then. Goodbye.
{c255}I can't believe you fixed it without me. Oh, well ? let's go toast some Vipers!
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Sounds good to me.
{c16711680}Hee hee! Fun!
{c255}Okay, here you go. I hope they're useful, somehow.
{c-16777216}
{c255}No, I don't think so. 100 caps, or I hang onto them.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}All right. Here's 100 caps.
{c16711680}Okay. Here money.
{c16711680}I don't have the caps right now.
{c16711680}Argh. Me poor! Can't buy.
{c16711680}Keep them, then. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Me not want them anymore. Goodbye.
{c255}I have no idea what that is, but you might still be in luck. My cousin, Symm, showed up yesterday. He travels all over the wasteland, collecting odd schematics. He might have what you need.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Where is he?
{c16711680}Where he?
{c255}Up at the top of the mesa, inspecting the condensors. Azkee didn't waste any time putting him to work, as usual.
{c-16777216}Cure Radian's illness.Radian says he's sick, but he doesn't know what's wrong with him.I used my medical skills to diagnose Radian, and it turns out that he has High Desert Fever.I could treat Radian's illness, but I need a doctor's bag first.I cured Radian's illness.Instead of curing Radian, I gave him some extremely addictive painkillers instead. He'll feel cured, but only for a few hours.Sabotage Mesa Verde's wind turbine.I used Radian's painkiller addiction against him and forced him to sabotage the wind turbine for me.
{c255}*cough* What do you want, outsider?
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}*cough* Hello, again.
{c255}Hello, doctor! Thanks again for curing me.
{c255}Hey, doctor, I think I'm getting sick again. I could {i}really {}use some more of that mediciine.
{c16711680}What do you do around here, Radian?
{c16711680}What you do here?
{c16711680}Are you all right?
{c16711680}You not look good.
{c16711680}I can probably do something about that illness, Radian.
{c16711680}Well, Radian, that medicine isn't cheap or easy to come by.
{c255}Radian. [He begins to shake uncontrollably.]
{c16711680}What do you do around here?
{c255}*cough* No. Pretty sick. Not sure what's wrong.
{c16711680}Hmmm... dilated pupils, clammy skin... do you feel thirsty and dizzy all the time?
{c16711680}You sick. Me doctor. Me fix you.
{c16711680}Sorry to hear that. What do you do here?
{c16711680}Oh. What you do here?
{c255}Yeah. Been using up more than my share of water. *cough*
{c16711680}It sounds like you've got High Desert Fever. It's not contagious, but it'll eventually kill you if it isn't treated.
{c255}*cough* Can you help me?
{c16711680}Yes, I can. The fever can be treated with common medicines available in my doctor's bag.
{c16711680}I could, but I don't have a doctor's bag with me right now.
{c255}Thank you. *cough*
{c16711680}[Pull out supplies from your doctor's bag and give Radian the cure.]
{c16711680}[Use supplies from your doctor's bag to give Radian some extremely addictive painkillers instead of the cure.]
{c255}Please! I need more medicine. I have no money, but I'll do anything. {i}Anything!
{c16711680}Sing for me.
{c16711680}Anything, huh? Would you sabotage the wind turbine?
{c255}Uh... okay. Ahem. "Give me a kiss to build a dream on, and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss. Sweetheart, I ask no more than this: a kiss to build a dream on."{i}
{c16711680}Nice, very nice.
{c16711680}Now I want you to do is to sabotage the wind turbine.
{c255}I can't do that! We couldn't make any more water, and we'd all be doomed!{i}
{c16711680}Well, I guess you don't need more medicine after all, then. I'll just go sell it, or maybe throw it away, or feed it to an ill-tempered brahmin...
{c255}No, no! Wait! You bastard, what have you done to me? I'll do what you ask ? just give me the medicine.{i}
{c255}No, no! Wait! You bitch, what have you done to me? I'll do what you ask ? just give me the medicine.{i}
{c16711680}I don't think so, Radian. Do what I asked first, and {i}then {}you'll get your medicine.
{c255}D-don't go anywhere. I'll do it, and be right back.{i}
{c16711680}All right. Oh, and Radian - don't even think about betraying me.
{c255}*cough* Wow... I'm feeling pretty good... and sleepy. {i}
{c16711680}Why don't you just take a nap now, and I'll come see you again in a few hours.
{c255}I'll do that. Thanks, doctor.{i}
{c255}Wow! I feel much better already! Thanks, doctor!{i}
{c16711680}I'll check back in an hour to see how you're doing. Goodbye.
{c255}*cough* Usually the same as everybody else ? farm, hunt, and guard the village. Been too weak to do that lately.{i}
{c255}I'm back to helping out with the farming and hunting, thanks to you.{i}
{c255}I'm feeling a little better, but I'm starting to get the shakes again.{i}

{c255}*cough* You, a doctor? Right. *cough* Thanks for the offer, but stay away from me.{i}
{c16711680}Okay. What you do here?
{c255}Oh. *cough* Thanks, anyway.{i}
{c16711680}What do you do here?
{c255}There, it's done. Give me my medicine!{i}
{c16711680}Good. Here's your medicine.
{c255}Am I done humiliating myself? Can I have the medicine now?{i}
{c16711680}Sure. Here you go.
{c16711680}Not just yet. I'd also like you to sabotage the wind turbine for me.
{c255}Ahhhh... feeling {i}so {}much better again.
{c255}*cough* Hey! Hey, doctor! It's me! Radian, remember?
{c255}*cough* Hey, doctor. You, uh, brought some medicine for me?
{c16711680}Why, hello, Radian. What are you doing in Hoover Dam?
{c16711680}Yes, I did. You'll need to do something for me first, though.
{c255}*cough* Village is gone ? Vipers got everybody except me. Hey, have you got any more medicine for me? The stuff around here's not so good.
{c16711680}Sure, Radian. But, there's something I need you to do, first.
{c16711680}Sorry, I'm out.
{c255}Again? Okay, what you want done, and I'll go do it. *cough*
{c16711680}[Pending on Hoover Dam quests]
{c255}*cough* Well, I'm not going anywhere. Do me a favor and scrounge some up for me, will you? *cough*"The smell of the capitalist pigs is everywhere."Denom says that Azkee had complained that the crops were too scrawny, so Denom used a special fertilizer he bought from a traveling merchant which made the crops grow big.Denom say he use special dirt on plants. Now plants grow big. "We are cunning and sneaky!""Our cause is just.""The next great proletarian revolution has begun!"The door is locked.
{c255}Help us! They're everywhere!
{c16711680}Slow down. What are you talking about?
{c16711680}Me not understand. What you talking about?
{c255}Thanks for your help! I'm Denom.
{c255}That was messy. By the way, I'm Denom.
{c255}Hello. Is there something I can do for you?
{c16711680}What were those creatures?
{c16711680}What those creatures?
{c16711680}Azkee is concerned about the crops. He says that they're a bit larger than normal.
{c16711680}Bald leader guy worry about crops. Say they too big.
{c16711680}That fertilizer you used on the crops is radioactive.
{c16711680}Dirt is all glowy and stuff. Very bad.
{c16711680}I brought back a bag of seeds from that wheat I told you about.
{c16711680}Me bring seeds. 
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}I have no idea. We've never seen them before. They just seemed to spring out of the ground.
{c16711680}What's your job here?
{c16711680}What job you do?
{c255}Plant creatures, in the fields! We need help killing them!
{c16711680}All right, I'm on it.
{c16711680}Okay, me go kill them.
{c16711680}Not my problem. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Nope. Goodbye.
{c255}I'm in charge of overseeing the crops, as well as keeping the turbine and condensors running.
{c16711680}Tell me about the turbine.
{c16711680}Me wanna know about turbine.
{c16711680}How do the condensors work?
{c16711680}Wanna know about condensors.
{c255}We get a lot of wind up here, so the founders of the village built the wind turbine up here to generate electricity. It isn't much energy, but it's enough to power the condensors.
{c16711680}What do the condensors do?
{c16711680}What condensors do?
{c255}The condensors trap moisture in the wind and collect the water for us. It's very slow ? a little more than day's worth of water for the whole village each day. They're powered by the turbine.
{c255}I can't believe he's complaining about the crops {i}again{}. Just a few weeks ago, he was upset with me because the crops were too scrawny.
{c16711680}The crops were too scrawny? What did you do to improve them?
{c16711680}How you make crops big?
{c255}I used some special fertilizer I got off a merchant who passed through here. He claimed it could make anything grow, and he was right. It's great stuff!
{c16711680}I'd like to examine this fertilizer.
{c16711680}Me want to look at fertilizer.
{c255}I used it all up, but the barrel it came in is in the storage shed over there. Why? What's wrong?
{c16711680}I don't know yet. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Me not know yet. Goodbye.
{c255}What? No, it's not. There must be a mistake.
{c255}"Glowy"? What are you talking about?
{c16711680}There's no mistake. I examined the fertilizer barrel with a geiger counter, and it's moderately radioactive.
{c16711680}Glowy! Point thingie at barrel, it go "beep beep beep!"
{c255}Oh, no! I've poisoned our fields, and our crops! What am I going to do? We're all going to starve!
{c255}Oh, no! It's radioactive? I've poisoned our fields, and our crops! What am I going to do? We're all going to starve!
{c16711680}I don't know right now. I'll speak to Azkee about it.
{c16711680}Dunno. Me talk to bald leader guy.
{c16711680}A group at Hoover Dam has developed a type of wheat which cleans the ground it grows in of radiation. I could get some for you.
{c16711680}Big dam people make plant that clean glowy stuff from dirt. Me get some for you.
{c255}He's going to have me banished for this, I know it.
{c255}Really? That's incredible! Yes, please get some for me!
{c255}Thank you! I'll start planting these right away.
{c16711680}Whoa, not so fast, farmboy. Those seeds aren't free.
{c16711680}Nope, you gimme money first. Seeds not free.
{c255}Oh... uh, of course not. You'll have to talk to Azkee about that.You opened the door with the %s key.
{c255}Yes, outsider?
{c255}Outsider! What do you know about what happened here?
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}What are you talking about?
{c16711680}What you say?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}In order to remain within the village, I must work, something I cannot do if you continue to disturb me. What do you need?
{c16711680}Trig said you might know something about a docking clamp.
{c16711680}You know stuff about docking thingie?
{c255}I am Symm. Is there something you need from me?
{c255}My people have been {b}slaughtered! {}You are an outsider. What do you know about this?{bc255}Idiot! {}My people are dead! What do you know about this?
{c16711680}Well, last time I was here, they were having some trouble with the Vipers. Looks like the Vipers won.
{c16711680}Maybe snake guys kill them.
{c16711680}Everything. I was the one who killed them.
{c16711680}Me kill everybody.
{c255}Then the Vipers shall pay for the murders of my people. Step aside, outsider. My vengeance awaits.
{c16711680}Wait! Do you know anything about a docking clamp?
{c16711680}Wait! Me need docking thingie!
{c255}I have explored many places of the Old World and stored many things in my Pip. Perhaps what you need is in there. I see that you, too, have a Pip. I shall transfer what I know to you. 
{c255}I shall avenge my people! {b}Die!Drake, the leader of the Viper band blockading Mesa Verde, mentioned that I could help them out by sabotaging the village's wind turbine. Without the turbine, the village can't get any more water.I've agreed to sabotage Mesa Verde's wind turbine for the Vipers. Drake warned me to leave the Ciphers alive for the Vipers.I was able to sabotage Mesa Verde's wind turbine without being noticed.While I was able to sabotage Mesa Verde's wind turbine, my activities were noticed and I had to defend myself from the enraged Ciphers.You aided the Ciphers by sabotaging the Ciphers' wind turbine.
{c255}This path is forbidden to travel by order of Hecate, stranger. You may not pass.
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}Sure I can! Watch ? I'll just kill you and then push your corpse out of my way.
{c16711680}Yaaaaaaaaargh! [Attack him.]
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}We meet again. Why have you come before us?
{c255}Were you successful in disabling the Ciphers' wind turbine?
{c16711680}Who are you, again?
{c16711680}Me forget. Who you?
{c16711680}Not yet. I'm still working on it.
{c16711680}Nope. Not done yet.
{c16711680}Yes, I sabotaged the turbine.
{c16711680}Yup, me broke wind thingie.
{c16711680}Tell me again about how I can help you.
{c16711680}How me help you, again?
{c255}I am Drake, Chosen of Hecate and leader of these Vipers.
{c16711680}Why are you blocking this trail?
{c16711680}Why you in me way?
{c16711680}Who's Hecate?
{c16711680}Who Hecate?
{c16711680}Your gang's name is the Vipers?
{c16711680}Snakes? Me not see snakes.
{c255}She is our goddess, the one who gives us purpose and power. She commands almost all the tribals of the wasteland.
{c16711680}I see. So, where does Hecate live?
{c16711680}Where she live?
{c255}Ouroborus, to the northwest. You have a device which holds maps ? I shall mark the location down for you. [He enters the coordinates in your PipBoy.] 
{c16711680}You say you lead snakes. Me not see snakes.
{c255}A foolish group of tribals called the Ciphers has chosen to defy Hecate. She has ordered their destruction as punishment.
{c16711680}How did they defy her?
{c16711680}Why she make them dead?
{c16711680}There doesn't appear to be much destroying going on.
{c16711680}You here, not bashing and killing. Not understand.
{c255}All tribals must have a Daughter of Hecate among them to promote fertility and carry out the will of Hecate. The Ciphers refused, and now they shall pay dearly for their heresy.
{c16711680}So why are you here instead of killing the Ciphers?
{c16711680}Me not see you killing. How come?
{c16711680}You said your gang's name is the Vipers?
{c255}Mesa Verde is strong. We have been unable to break through, so now we wait to starve them out. We cannot go back to Hecate until we have carried out her will.
{c16711680}Maybe I can help you with your attack.
{c16711680}Me help you kill.
{c255}We are no "gang", stranger. Once, perhaps, years ago. Now we are Hecate's holy warriors, crushing any who displease her or otherwise stand in her way.
{c255}*sigh* Had a Daughter been present at your birth, stranger, you would have been cast out into the wasteland to die. {i}We {}are the Vipers. It is the name of our band of holy warriors.
{c255}You are not one of us, and cannot be allowed the honor of fighting beside us. Nor {i}can {}you become one of us ? one is born a Viper, not made.
{c16711680}Well, is there anything I can {i}else {}I can do?
{c16711680}How me help you, then?
{c255}You are unknown to the Ciphers. Perhaps you can gain access to the village and destroy their wind turbine for us. Without the turbine, they will have no source of water.
{c16711680}I'll do it.
{c16711680}Me do it.
{c16711680}If I do it, what's it worth to you?
{c16711680}You gimme money to do?
{c255}You {b}dare {}ask for money to carry out Hecate's will? We should kill you for such an insult.
{c16711680}Okay, fine. I'll do it for free.
{c16711680}Ack. Me do it for free, okay?
{c16711680}Bring it, punk!{bc16711680}Me {}insulted. You die!
{c255}Then I wish you success, stranger. Do not harm any of the Ciphers ? that honor belongs to us.
{c255}Excellent. And the Ciphers? Do they still live?
{c16711680}Uh... yeah, sure they are. Happy and alive, that's them.
{c16711680}Ummm... yup?
{c16711680}No. They saw me sabotaging the turbine, and I was forced to kill them.
{c16711680}Nope. They see me break wind thingie, so me kill them.
{c16711680}Yes, they're still alive, just as you asked.
{c16711680}Yup, they not dead.
{c255}Good. I suggest you journey to Ouroborus, stranger. Hecate will want to hear of your deeds in her service. Here ? I shall mark its location in your mapping device. 
{c255}That was {b}our {}duty, not yours! We must kill you now to avenge our dishonor!
{c16711680}Bring it!
{c16711680}Me kill you first!Betty
{c255}I hear the lie in your voice and see it in your eyes. Their deaths were {b}our {}duty, not yours! We must kill you now to avenge our dishonor!
{c255}Do it immediately. Hecate grows impatient.Ponytail 1Ponytail 2Braid
{c16711680}Not good enough. Goodbye. 
{c255}Excellent. Please, repair the computer quickly. We cannot afford to lose any more schematics.
{c255}Be careful, outsider. They are merciless warriors.
{c255}Physics, chemistry, mathematics. Our ancestors were great scientists, you know. They came to Mesa Verde for shelter after their old home, a great place of science, was destroyed.
{c16711680}Mesa Verde doesn't seem all that... advanced to me. 
{c16711680}This place not look all sciencey and stuff.
{c16711680}Where was this place of science?
{c16711680}Where they come from?
{c255}We prefer the simple life here. It is the preservation of the knowledge itself that is important to us. Our ancestors taught that it was reckless {i}use{} of that knowledge which destroyed the world.
{c16711680}Where did your ancestors come from?
{c16711680}Where ancestors come from?
{c16711680}Do you use your knowledge for anything?
{c16711680}Um, what stuff you do if you so smart?
{c255}Far to the south. It is dangerous there, however. Invisible fire burns the flesh from a man's bones. Our ancestors fled here for shelter, and to preserve their immense amount of knowledge.
{c16711680}Mesa Verde doesn't look very advanced.
{c255}Mathematics is the First Science. All children are taught it from the moment they begin to speak. This very intimate knowledge of mathematics is why our Ritual works. Most of the time, anyway.
{c16711680}All the Ciphers working together can act like a computer?
{c255}Electronics has long been a specialty of the Ciphers. Few in the wasteland understand it as much as we do, which is quite a surprise to those who think we are merely primitive tribals.
{c16711680}Do you have any electronics for sale?
{c16711680}Me buy things.
{c255}I am merely a teacher. Speak to Trig, our resident artisan."Burn capitalists burn!""Gray clothing for everyone! "Find out who's been stealing from Anson.I promised not to turn Marianne in for stealing from Anson's bar.When I told Marianne I was going to turn her in, she ran to her room, crying.I blackmailed Marianne into giving all her money to me in exchange for not turning her in.Marianne, one of Anson's prostitutes, admitted to stealing from him after I showed her the drugs I found in her room.

{c16711680}Round the Wasteland, baby.
{c16711680}Me want to go Round Wasteland.
{c255}You're lucky. Me, I made one gamble too many and got myself in debt to some really bad guys. They ended up selling me to Anson.
{c255}Uh... okay. What I meant is that you're free, and can leave when you want. I'm not.
{c16711680}You're a slave?
{c16711680}You be slave?
{c255}Indentured servant, actually. Well, I'm pretty much a slave, but if I pay off my debt to Anson, I'm a a free girl. 
{c16711680}Maybe I could pay off your debt.
{c16711680}Maybe me pay your debt?
{c255}Ha! I wish it was that easy. No, Anson says it's {i}my {}debt, and he says I have to work it off lying on my back like an "honest" woman.
{c16711680}How much for your "services"?
{c16711680}Me want sex.
{c255}What are you doing searching my room? And, uh, besides, I have no idea how those got in there.
{c16711680}Maybe I'll just tell Anson where I found these and let him decide who's telling the truth.
{c16711680}Me tell Anson, then. He know you be liar.
{c16711680}My mistake. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Oh, okay. Goodbye.
{c255}No, wait! I admit I stole the drugs, but it was only so I could raise money faster so I can buy my freedom from Anson. I don't want to be a whore anymore! Please - don't tell him.
{c16711680}All right, I won't tell Anson it was you.

{c255}Hey, there! Need something from Doc Lane's big bag of medicine, or just some some supplies? 
{c255}Oh, um, hey. You need some supplies?
{c255}You again. What now?

{c16711680}Stuff going on here?
{c16711680}I need your services.
{c16711680}You fix me.
{c16711680}You know, it occurs to me that I should get a discount for keeping your lack of medical skill a secret.
{c16711680}If you want, I could teach you some real medical skills.
{c255}I'm Doc Lane. I run this general store, and I'm also the town doctor. 
{c255}I'm Doc Lane, and you, it seems, should've taken more Mentats when you were growing up. I run this store, and I'm also the town doctor.
{c16711680}Me buy things.
{c16711680}Anything interesting happening around here?
{c255}Heard there's a bunch of religious crazies attacking the caravans. I figure they're probably after the water to give to their brahmin god or something. Talk to the sheriff if you want to know more.
{c255}It's been pretty quiet around here ever since you solved the problem with those crazy Mormons. Town's doing great, thanks to you. I hope this means Anson's going to get some more girls in soon.
{c255}You've come to the right man. Okay, let's see... you need some stimpaks, or something stronger? Rad-Away, maybe? 
{c16711680}Show me what you have.

{c16711680}Okay, "Doc", where's the anterior cruciate ligament?
{c255}It's, uh, I'm pretty sure I know this one... right above the heart?
{c16711680}Middle of the knee, actually. You don't have any medical training at all, do you?
{c255}All right, all right, I confess! I just said I was a doctor because, well, the town hasn't got one. Wait... if you know where the anterior liga-thingie is, why were you asking {i}me {}to patch {i}you {}up?{u}
{c16711680}Forget about it. Just show me what you have for sale.
{c16711680}Shut up. I want a discount at your store or I'll tell everyone you're a fraud.
{c16711680}Maybe I'm just lazy. In any case, if you've got the time, I could teach you some {i}real {}doctor skills.
{c255}*sigh* All right, ten percent off on everything. Just don't tell anyone about me!
{c16711680}Deal. Show me what you have.
{c16711680}A twenty percent discount sounds a {i}lot {}better than being run out of town, don't you think?
{c16711680}No - thirty percent off. As the only store in town, you must make a quite a nice profit, and you can afford to hand some of that to {i}me{}.
{c16711680}It's a deal. Goodbye.
{c255}No way! Anything more than ten percent would ruin me.{u}
{c255}Fine, fine. You'll get a twenty percent discount, but don't expect friendly service!{u}
{c255}You're going to ruin me, I know it. But, thirty percent off it is, and not a single cap more.{u}
{c16711680}Too bad for you. I'll just kill you and loot your store, then.
{c16711680}We have a deal. Goodbye.
{c255}Well, I guess I should at least know how to set a broken bone.{u}
{c16711680}I'll show you how to do that in addition to some other simple first aid treatments.
{c16711680}Actually, this is a waste of my time. Goodbye.Anson said that someone's been stealing from his bar late at night.

{c255}Careful! Those pipes are hot. What do you need?
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Hey, there. What do you need?
{c255}You again. Do you like bothering me or something?
{c16711680}Got any work for me?
{c16711680}Me want work.
{c16711680}Tell me about the job again.
{c16711680}How does the plant work?
{c16711680}How plant work?
{c16711680}I'm finished with the repair work.
{c16711680}I built an automated pump for the plant.
{c16711680}The sheriff told me to talk to you about the worker who escaped.
{c16711680}Tell me stuff about worker who run away.
{c255}I'm Caulwell, and this is my water plant. Well, technically, it's the town's plant, but I run it. I also keep on eye on the convicts, make sure they don't run off or anything.
{c255}Great ? a moron. I'm Caulwell. I run this place and watch the bad guys who work here. Try not to touch any of the equipment, okay?
{c16711680}Me wanna know about worker who run away.
{c16711680}Goodbye
{c255}It's pretty simple, actually. Salt water gets pumped in from the lake to the boilers, the salt gets boiled out of the water, the steam condenses in those contraptions there, and the fresh water collects in the vat.
{c255}Uh, look, it's a long complicated process. Let's just say we can magically turn salt water into fresh water, okay?
{c16711680}Do you have any work for me?
{c16711680}You're pumping in water from the lake by hand. That doesn't seem very efficient.
{c255}Hey, that wasn't {i}my{} fault! I keep an eye on these guys during their shift, and after that, it's up to the sheriff's deputies. 
{c16711680}What exactly happened?
{c16711680}What happen?
{c255}I'm not sure how Ivan did it. There's only one door in and out of the worker's barracks, and somehow he managed to get out without being spotted by the deputy on duty.
{c16711680}Any ideas on where he might be now?
{c16711680}Where he go?
{c255}A guy sneaky enough to get past one of the sheriff's deputies probably stowed away with one of the water caravans. I'd check out all the main caravan stops ? Hoover Dam, Fort Abandon, maybe Denver.
{c255}If you know which end of wrench to hold, you can make yourself useful by inspecting the pipework, storage vat, and filling station. Pay is 50 caps, no more.
{c255}Like I said before, you can make yourself useful by inspecting the pipework, storage vat, and filling station. I can only pay you 50 caps, but the job really isn't that difficult.
{c16711680}I'll do it.
{c16711680}No thanks. Goodbye.
{c255}Sorry, but your lack of brains probably means you think a wrench is some kind of fancy club used to smash fragile equipment. Run along and play somewhere else, okay?
{c16711680}Me smash {b}you{} dead!
{c255}Good. Here's the money I owe you.
{c255}No, it's not. Even when I make sure these sorry bastards aren't slacking off, they can only pump in the water so fast. There's not much I can do about it, short of working these guys to death.
{c16711680}What about some sort of automated pump? It wouldn't replace the workers, but it could speed up production.
{c255}Yeah... yeah, that would work, but where would you get one, and how would you power it?
{c16711680}You'll probably need some sort of generator to power the pump. If I see anything in my travels, I'll let you know.
{c255}If you can bring me back an automated pump and a generator, I'll see to it that Jericho pays you a ton of caps. That equipment's the sort of thing we need to really make this town take off.
{c255}Great! How do you run it?
{c16711680}I also built a generator which runs on salicornia oil, which, if I'm not mistaken, you've got plenty of around here.
{c16711680}Uh, I haven't solved that problem yet.
{c255}Really? Who would've thought that such a thing was possible? All right, let's get his equipment installed. Jones! Wilson! Get your sorry asses over here and help this man.
{c255}Really? Who would've thought that such a thing was possible? All right, let's get his equipment installed. Jones! Wilson! Get your sorry asses over here and help this lady.
{c16711680}Let's install the pump over there, and I think the best place for the generator would be over there...
{c255}Oh. In that case, you can just hang onto that pump for now.
{c255}We're done here, and it looks like everything's working. Great! Go talk to the sheriff and let him know about the plant's upgrades. Thanks for all your help!I convinced Ivan to come peacefully with me back to Jericho by promising to speak to the sheriff about assigning Ivan a healthier job.Me tell Ivan me talk to sheriff so Ivan get good job. Ivan come without fighting to Jericho now.I let Ivan go free and said I would tell the sheriff that Ivan was already dead when I found him.Me let Ivan go. Me tell sheriff that Ivan dead.Ivan refused to come back to Jericho peacefully. When I tried to force the issue, he attacked me and I had to kill him.Ivan not want to come back to Jericho. Me try to make him go, and he attack. Me kill him.
{c255}Yeah? What do you want?
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}What are you doing?
{c16711680}What you doing?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}W-what? Why are you bothering me again?
{c255}Off to Jericho, I guess?
{c16711680}You're the Ivan who ran away from Jericho, aren't you?
{c16711680}You run away from Jericho!
{c16711680}Let's go.
{c16711680}We go Jericho now.
{c255}Um, Ivan. 
{c16711680}You're the worker who escaped from Jericho!
{c16711680}Ivan... Ivan... hey, you run away from Jericho!
{c255}I'm searching this trash for anything valuable. Hey, uh, if this is your claim, I'll just go somewhere else, okay?
{c255}No! You're wrong. You're, uh, thinking of somebody else!
{c16711680}No, I've got the right guy.
{c16711680}Nuh-uh! Me not {i}that {}stupid. You who me look for!
{c16711680}Sorry about that. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Oh. Me sorry. Goodbye.
{c255}Okay, okay - you got me. But, I'll die if you take me back!
{c16711680}How did you manage to escape?
{c16711680}How you escape?
{c16711680}Why will you die?
{c16711680}How come you die?
{c16711680}You'll die right {i}now {}if you don't start walking.{ic16711680}Me {}make you die if you not go.
{c255}I'm not built for manual labor! That plant is going to kill me! All I did was take a {i}few {}things that weren't mine. If I go back to that place, my lungs are going to collapse. Please, just let me go.
{c16711680}I'll mention that to the sheriff. He's a reasonable man - maybe he'll assign you some other job.
{c16711680}Me tell sheriff. He nice guy - maybe he make you do other job.
{c16711680}All right. You're free to go. I'll just tell the sheriff you're dead.
{c16711680}Okay, you go free. Me tell sheriff that you dead.
{c16711680}Enough. Don't make me have to drag your corpse back to Jericho.
{c16711680}No more talk. We go now!
{c255}Wait! Can't we work out a deal? Just tell the sheriff I'm already dead, and... uh...
{c16711680}And?
{c16711680}Uh?
{c16711680}You're wasting my time. Move!
{c16711680}No talk! Move!
{c255}I... I've got nothing. Sorry ? I've got no friends, no connections, and not a single cap in my pocket. Come on, I'm begging you for my {i}life {}here!
{c16711680}All right, I'll tell the sheriff you're already dead. Now get out of here.
{c16711680}Me be nice and say you dead. You go away now.
{c16711680}Too bad. It looks like you and I are going to Jericho.
{c16711680}Nope. We go Jericho.
{c255}If I'm going to die, I might as well take you with me, you bastard!
{c255}If I'm going to die, I might as well take you with me, you bitch!
{c16711680}You just {i}had{} to do it the hard way.
{c16711680}Okay, you die now.
{c255}Thanks! I won't forget this!
{c255}Well, all right, that sounds like it could work. Okay, I'll go with you.
{c16711680}Stay right here. I need to take care of something first. And don't even think about running. If I have to hunt you down again...
{c16711680}You stay. Me go do stuff first. If you run away, me get very, very angry.
{c16711680}Okay, let's go.
{c16711680}We go.
{c255}No, I think you'd just make the sheriff mad, and then he'll take it out on {i}me{}.
{c16711680}Well, I don't want to send you to your death. I'll just tell the sheriff that you're already dead.
{c16711680}Me not want you dead, so me tell sheriff you be dead already.{b}
{c16711680}I'm done negotiating. Come with me, or else.
{c16711680}You go with me {b}now.
{c255}I'm not going anywhere, I swear! Uh, bring me back something to eat, will you?
{c255}The deputy on duty decided to go take a little "break" with one of Anson's girls. I snuck out, hid myself in a water barrel, and got shipped out with the water caravan next morning.
{c16711680}Well, now you're going back with me.
{c16711680}Me take you back now.BeardExterminate the rats, roaches, and wasps in Jericho.I've agreed to kill the critters which have become a nuisance to Jericho. The sheriff wants me to wipe out the wasps at Union Station, the cockroaches in the northwest part of town, and the giant rats in the old sewers.Me kill bugs and stuff for sheriff. Wasps in choo-choo station, roaches in northwest town, rats in stinky sewers.Sheriff O'Connor has asked me to track down a convict named Ivan who escaped from his job at the water plant. He suggested that I speak to Caulwell at the plant for further details.Sheriff say me supposed to find guy who run away from plant. Guy named Ivan. Sheriff say me talk to Caulwell.SmallStop Jeremiah and the Hands of God from attacking Jericho's caravans.A group of Mormons calling themselves the Hands of God are attacking Jericho's water caravans. Sheriff O'Connor wants me to kill their leader, a man named Jeremiah. O'Connor thinks I can pull this off without harming any of the women and children in the Mormon camp.Marmets doing bad things to caravans. Sheriff say me kill Jeremiah, leader of Marmets. He say not kill kids and women in camp.I killed Jeremiah and ended the Mormon threat to Jericho.Me killed Marmet leader Jeremiah.I convinced Jeremiah that living in Jericho alongside the "sinners" was a great opportunity for the Mormons to do some preaching and converting. Now all I need to do is to tell Sheriff O'Connor about Jeremiah's truce offer.I told Sheriff O'Connor about Jeremiah's truce offer, and he grudgingly accepted it.I lied to Sheriff O'Connor and said that the Mormons were going to attack Jericho, and he believed me. He and a group of his men are coming with me to wipe out the Mormons.Me say Marmets come to kill everybody, and stupid sheriff believe me. Now we go kill all the Marmets.I tried to trick Sheriff O'Connor into attacking the Mormons, but he saw through my lies and became rather angry with me.Me try to trick sheriff so he attack Marmets, but me not good enough liar.

Instead, O'Connor assigned Ivan to a healthier job, but added six months to his sentence as punishment for running away.
{c16711680}Only one?
{c255}Yes, it does. However, we'd like to see to it that Hoover Dam becomes a preferred customer. We're a large town ? importing all that water becomes... expensive.
{c16711680}I see. What's in it for me?
{c255}Ha ha! Yes, well, you {i}are {}only giving us one product of your own, aren't you?
{c16711680}True. So, what products do {i}you {}have to offer?
{c16711680}Yes, but Jericho's water must be particularly valuable to Hoover Dam for you to come all the way here. It seems to me that Hoover Dam should be offering access to more than one product.
{c255}We can offer custom-made NCR assault rifles and armor ? always popular items. And last but not least ? NCR action figures!
{c16711680}All right, I've made my decision.
{c16711680}NCR action figures?
{c16711680}You're only offering access to {i}one {}of these products?
{c16711680}Actually, forget about Jericho for now. Let's talk about Hoover Dam can do for {i}me{}.
{c255}You have a point. I'm sure my bosses won't be {i}too {}upset if I offered Jericho exclusive access to {i}two {}of our exports.
{c16711680}Good. So, what kind of products are available?
{c16711680}Now, let's talk about {i}my {}compensation.
{c255}Sorry, but I've only been allowed to offer access to {i}one {}of our many fine products. If that's unacceptable to you, then I'm afraid I'll have to talk to someone else.
{c16711680}All right. What kind of products are available?
{c16711680}Fine. Goodbye.
{c255}Well, if you agree to a lower rate, then I'm sure I could see to it that a special negotiator's fee is passed on to you. Say... 3000 caps?
{c16711680}3000 is acceptable. What kind of products do you offer?
{c16711680}Only 3000? Anything less than 4000 would be an insult.
{c16711680}You're wasting my time unless you're offering 5000.
{c16711680}Forget it. What's Hoover Dam offering?
{c255}Well, I'd hate to insult you. 4000 it is. Now, shall we discuss the terms of the contract?
{c255}Well, I'd certainly hate to waste your time, so 5000 it is. Now, shall we discuss the terms of the contract?
{c16711680}Maybe later. Goodbye.
{c255}I'm very sorry, but 3000 is all I've been authorized to offer. Take it or leave it.
{c16711680}I'll take it.
{c16711680}I'll leave it. Goodbye.
{c255}I'm happy you see my position. Now, shall we discuss the terms of the contract?
{c16711680}Yes. What kind of products does Hoover Dam offer?
{c255}So, which one of our fine products would Jericho like access to?
{c255}Since you've bartered for two of our products, I guess you'll be wanting the weapons and the armor?
{c16711680}I'll take the weapons. You can never have enough guns.
{c16711680}Jericho could use better armor. I'll take the armor.
{c16711680}The action figures, of course. I'd be crazy not to pick those!{b}
{c16711680}Yes, that's right. Jericho needs betters weapons and armor.{b}
{c16711680}No, I'll take the guns... and the action figures.{b}
{c16711680}No, I'll take the armor... and the action figures.{b}
{c16711680}Actually, I'm still thinking. Goodbye.
{c255}All right, just sign here... and here... and here. We're done! Pleasure doing business with you! Perhaps we'll see you in Hoover Dam sometime.
{c255}Yes, foot tall replicas of our brave NCR Rangers. They come with a variety of miniature weapons, and you can pose them in just about any way imaginable. Very popular item, I might add.
{c16711680}Sold! Jericho needs action figures!
{c16711680}Uh, right. I think I know what I want now.
{c16711680}I'll get back to you. Goodbye.
{c255}Great choice! As a matter of fact, I happen to have one with me. Here ? hours of enjoyment await you! Now, if you'll sign here... and here... and here. We're done! Pleasure doing business with you! 
{c255}Great choices! I just happen to have an action figure with me ? here, enjoy! Now, if you'll sign here... and here... and here. We're done! Pleasure doing business with you!

{c255}Are you the Overseer?!
{c16711680}No, I'm . Who are you?
{c255}I'm Frank. Until the Overseer arrives, I'm supposed to be running things here. I'm off to an awful bad start!
{c16711680}Why? What's wrong?
{c255}We have a whole bunch of problems! Something's wrong with the generator, and I can't fix it because I'm locked out! I went to go get the floating eye bot to fix it, but something's wrong with him, too!
{c255}Until the generator is fixed, that darn computer won't let us activate the life support systems. It's getting too gosh darn hot in here!
{c16711680}Where's the generator room?
{c16711680}Where's the computer room?
{c16711680}How do you turn on the life support?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Well, the generator room as at the end of the hall to your left. But that won't do you any good unless you find the security kit in the storage room behind me. You'll need it to unlock the door.
{c255}The computer room is down the hall and to your right. The computer won't work until the generator's fixed, though! If you can get the generator room door open, you can fix it with a tool kit from the storage room. Or, you could fix the eye bot and get him to repair the generator.
{c255}Once the generator's running, just use the computer to turn on the life support. Then all we need is to get the eye bot repaired so he can patrol the vault. You know, in case any Commies try to break in!
{c255}Have you fixed the life support yet?! It's really getting hot in here. You need to fix the generator and get the computer to activate life support.
{c255}Thanks for getting the life support up and running. I feel better already!

Apparently, Presper has felt I've become too big a threat and wants me dead.I convinced Captain Pierce that Presper would eventually turn against him as well, and Pierce let me walk away without a fight.I fooled Captain Pierce into thinking that Presper and I were on the same side, and that my interference with Presper's plans is just one big mistake. As a result, Pierce let me walk away.I killed Presper's henchmen Pierce in the Grand Canyon.

{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}I broke it in a fall.
{c255}I was climbing while on a hunt, and I fell and broke it.
{c13209}Why no fix leg? Leg looks bad.
{c16711680}Why hasn't your tribe's healer fixed it yet? It looks pretty bad.
{c255}The Daughter won't fix it. She says I don't respect the goddess. I'm afraid I won't be able to walk when the bone heals.
{c255}The Daughter of Hecate won't help me because she says I haven't shown proper respect for Hecate and the spirits. I'm really afraid that the bone's not going to heal right and I won't be able to walk.
{c13209}Me go talk to Daughter for you.
{c16711680}I'm going to talk to the Daughter and see if I can clear this up.
{c255}Normally I'd say no to an idiot who wanted to fix a broken leg, but I'm desperate. Go ahead, you fix.
{c255}Uh ... okay, packleader, if you think you can help ... go ahead, you fix.
{c255}If you can help, go ahead.

{c16711680}I'm not ready to fix your leg yet. I'll come back later.
{c255}Arrrgh, that really hurt! But the pain does seem to be going away. Thanks, I hope you fixed it.
{c255}My leg is healed! I found these plants for you. I think the Daughter uses them for healing. Thank you for your help.
{c255}Hello! I wanted to give you these plants for your help with my broken leg. It is fully healed! I don't know what the plants do, but I think the Daughter uses them for healing.
{c13209}Xander root and broc flower! Thanks! Welcome! Goodbye!
{c16711680}Xander root and broc flower, yes, I can use these. Thanks, Fast-Hands. I'm glad I could help. Goodbye.
{c255}And what did she say?
{c13209}She told me you and she do sex. Then you stop sex with her. She upset.
{c16711680}She told me about your affair. This isn't about offending the goddess, this is about you being an asshole and her feelings are hurt. 
{c13209}Me play trick on her, she promise to help you in the morning.
{c16711680}Let's just say that I found a way to convince her to help you. She'll be here in the morning.
{c255}What? I knew it! That bitch!
{c13209}She say she fix leg if you say sorry.
{c16711680}She said she'd fix your leg if you apologized.
{c255}Whatever works to get my leg healed is fine with me. Thanks.
{c255}I won't apologize to her! She is supposed to take care of us, not let us turn into cripples!
{c13209}You say you sorry or me hit you in face.
{c16711680}You apologize to her or I'll beat the shit out of you, asshole. Just apologize to Hecate in front of everyone, the daughter will accept that as an apology to her.
{c13209}You no be stupid. She want to help. You say sorry, everything okay. No sorry, you never walk.
{c16711680}Don't be stupid. She's willing to help you. Just apologize and you'll be able to hunt when your leg heals right. If you don't, you probably won't walk again.
{c255}You wouldn't hit me! I can't fight back like this! You ... fine, I'll apologize in the morning. Now go away.
{c255}Wha ... but packleader, you can't ... uh ... fine, I'll apologize in the morning. Now go away.
{c255}You're right. I'll apologize to her tomorrow. Now, how can I say this without losing face in front of the rest of the tribe....

{c16711680}Me kill you.

{c16711680}We'll just see about that, won't we? 
{c16711680}Me not die. You die!
{c255}I'd have expected you to have heard about Doctor Presper by now. He's got great plans for the wasteland, plans which {i}you've {}been interfering with.
{c16711680}Where is he?
{c16711680}What kind of "great" plans?
{c16711680}Enough talking. Let's do this.
{c255}Somewhere else. Why does it matter? You'll be dead in a few seconds, anyway.
{c16711680}Humor me. What plans of his have I been interfering with?
{c16711680}We'll see about that. It's on!
{c255}Presper's going to erase the mistakes of the NCR and remake civilization into what it {i}should {}have been after the Great War. You yourself have seen how badly the NCR's screwed everything up.
{c16711680}You actually think Presper's going to keep you around when he's finished with you?
{c16711680}Wait a second. I've been working towards that same goal! We're on the same side!
{c16711680}Well, you're not going to live to see it. Let's go!
{c255}Of course. Why wouldn't he?
{c16711680}You're a soldier ? violent, unpredictable, {i}uncivilized{}. Once he's got what he wants, Presper's going to remove you just like he wants you to remove me.
{c16711680}Forget it. Just die.
{c255}What the hell are you talking about?
{c16711680}Presper and I have similar plans, but it's because we're not working {i}together{} that we're getting in each other's way. I need to talk to him immediately.
{c16711680}Never mind. Let's get this fight over with.
{c255}, I think you're right. All, right ? you're not on my wrong side anymore, but it doesn't mean Presper's not going to send someone else gunning for you.{i}
{c16711680}Can't have that. How do I find Presper?
{c255}You know, it did seem like you were following us around, and now it all makes sense. All right, your execution's on hold until you've had a chance to straighten things out with Presper.
{c16711680}How do I find Presper?
{c255}Holy , you're a moron. I didn't think people like you could survive in the wasteland. Oh, well. I've got a job to do and you're it. Let's get this over with.
{c255}*sigh* I've got better things to do than try to explain things to a moron. Let's get this over with.{b}
{c16711680}Me kill you first!
{c255}Good try, good try ? you almost had me there. Now it's time for us to make some noise and put you in the ground.{b}
{c16711680}We'll see who gets put in the ground.
{c255}I think I'll just take my chances and deal with Presper if the time comes. But, right now, it's time to deal with you. Let's burn some clips, guys!
{c16711680}You just made your last mistake.
{c255}We're supposed to rendesvous at a place called Bloomfield. I can show you where it is, but I can't promise Presper will be there when you arrive. 
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Then, I'm afraid we must continue the hunt alone. Goodbye.
{c255}Thank you, ! Your skill and cunning undoubtedly was responsible for saving all of our people.
{c255}It is regrettable that a few of those taken will never see Mesa Verde again, but fortunately, your efforts have brought most of our people home. Thank you, .
{c255}We mourn those who were lost, but at least you managed to bring some of our people home. Thank you, .
{c255}This is a grim day for Mesa Verde. Your efforts are appreciated, . I must leave you now to mourn for my lost people.Disarm Ike's landmine.I met a ghoul explorer named Ike in the Grand Canyon.

{c255}Um, I've got a little problem with this landmine I'm standing on. If I move, boom! So, do you think you could help me out?

{c255}Howdy, stranger! Not many souls come visit the Grand Canyon these days. I'm Santiago, leader of this sorry-looking bunch. Who might you be?
{c16711680}I'm . What are you doing here?
{c16711680}Hello! Me . What you do here?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Howdy again! Came back to enjoy the view, eh?
{c16711680}Show me what you have for sale.
{c16711680}I buy stuff from you now.
{c16711680}I'm looking for a satellite which is supposed to have crashed near here. Know anything about it?
{c16711680}Me look for big space thing which fall out of sky. Know where it be?
{c16711680}Can I ask you some questions about the Grand Canyon?
{c16711680}Hello, San Diego. I ask questions about canyon, okay?
{c16711680}Do you know anything about the tram I saw on the North Rim?
{c16711680}What is flying box me see at north?
{c16711680}I was thinking about fixing the tram.
{c16711680}Me want to fix flying box.
{c16711680}Any news on the parts for the tram?
{c16711680}Got parts for flying box?
{c16711680}I want you to watch over the tram and collect tolls from the caravans for me.
{c16711680}You watch flying box for me? Take money from people with moos and carts?
{c255}Me and my boys here were salvagers. Santiago's Salvagers, that's what they used to call us. I guess you could that we're retired. {u}
{c255}Ah, missing a few gears upstairs, are ya? Well, no matter. Known plenty of honest, hard-working folks who weren't exactly the smartest cookies in the bunch. So, what can I do you for?
{c16711680}Do you anything about the tram on the North Rim?
{c16711680}Can I ask you some questions about the Grand Canyon?{i}
{c16711680}Me ask questions about canyon?
{c255}Sure, fire away.{u}
{c255}It's hot and it's radioactive, but it's got a lot of old equipment which is extremely valuable to salvagers like us. It's not exactly the sort of place you want to go sight-seeing in.{u}
{c255}Oh, the usual oversized wasteland beasts ? radscorpions, bees, lizards. Saw a huge two-headed rattlesnake once. I'm sure there are worse things down there.{u}
{c255}Go well-armed, bring a lot of Rad-X and Rad-Away, and don't bother with heavy armor ? the heat will drop you a heck of a lot faster if you're wearing anything heavier than leather.{u}
{c16711680}What can you tell me about the canyon itself?{i}
{c16711680}You know things about big canyon?
{c16711680}What kind of creatures can I expect in the canyon?
{c16711680}What bad things be in canyon?
{c16711680}Any advice for traveling in the canyon?
{c16711680}Me want advice for walking in canyon.
{c16711680}I have no more questions about the canyon. Show me what you have for sale.
{c16711680}No more questions. Me buy things now.
{c255}That old thing? Well, I guess in the old days people used it as a fast way to cross the gorge, but the machinery has been stripped of most of its parts now. Why do you ask?{u}
{c255}Big box thing? Hmmm... ah! That's the tram. It, uh, makes you fly across the canyon. Why do you ask?{u}
{c16711680}Maybe I can repair it.
{c16711680}I make it fly again?
{c255}Good luck with {i}that{}. One of the other groups stripped the machinery pretty good, and from the looks of it, I'd say you're probably not going to find those parts anywhere else in the wasteland.{u}
{c16711680}Do you think you could get those parts back for me?
{c16711680}You get parts back from friends?
{c255}Maybe. If those guys haven't gotten rid of the parts yet, they might be real eager to sell by now.{u}
{c16711680}All right, see what you can do.
{c16711680}Okay.
{c255}I sent the word out, but nothing yet. Give it a few more days.{u}
{c255}Yup, I actually got the parts back. Seems that the other guys weren't able to trade them away yet, lucky for you. Here you go.{u}
{c255}Howdy. As you can see, things around here have changed somewhat since the last time you visited.{u}
{c16711680}What are you talking about? Who are all these guys?
{c16711680}Who these people, San Diego? What they doing?
{c255}Said they're from the Crimson Caravan, and that we're squatting on their territory. I know it's a damn lie, but we're old men. Not much we can do about.{u}
{c16711680}I'll take them out.
{c16711680}Me will kill{b} {}them.
{c16711680}I'll to talk to their leader.
{c16711680}Me go talk to bad guy leader.
{c255}I figured you might do that. Look, when you make your move, me and the boys will back you up. I can't promise we'll be much help, but we might distract 'em enough for you to get your shots in.{u}
{c255}They don't seem to be the reasonable type, so watch your back.{u}
{c255}Hoo-boy! Haven't had that much fun in awhile, but damn, I'm gonna feel it tomorrow. We were lucky you came along this time. Next time ? if there {i}is {}a next time ? it could be real bad for us.{u}
{c16711680}I can show you how to shoot better. If you hold your gun like this, your arms will absorb the recoil better and you can fire multiple shots more accurately...
{c16711680}Uh, San Diego not shoot good. I show you how to shoot good. Shoot bad people better next time.
{c16711680}Just in case there is a next time, let me show you some ways to do a lot of damage in a short amount of amount of time using a lead pipe.
{c16711680}San Diego and friends not know how to fight good with sticks and knives and stuff. Here, me show you how to bash groin real good with pipe.
{c16711680}I'll show you some unarmed combat moves which will help you defeat someone even if he's bigger and stronger than you.
{c16711680}I show you good way to punch. No need guns or sticks.
{c255}I'm mighty impressed. You just {i}asked {}those thugs to return the Shortcut to us, and they gave it up without a fight? I sure hope you're around the next time this happens.{u}
{c16711680}I can show you how to shooter better. If you hold your gun like this, your arms will absorb the recoil better and you can fire multiple shots more accurately...
{c16711680}Just in case there is a next time, let me show you some ways to do a lot of damage in a short of amount of time using a lead pipe.
{c16711680}San Diego and friends not know how to fight good with sticks and knives and stuff. Here, me show you how to bash groin real good with pipe.
{c255}You got it working! And, you had the guts to ride this thing across the across the canyon ? must've been a hell of a view. So, what's the plan now? {u}
{c16711680}The Grand Canyon's location probably interferes with trade routes. Caravans could use the tram as a shortcut... after paying a toll, of course.
{c16711680}Canyon blocks peoples with carts and moos from bring stuff. They use box to fly across canyon. Me make them pay money.
{c16711680}I can't think of anything right now. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Not know right now. Goodbye.
{c255}That's a great idea. I know there are a couple of caravan that usually have to swing around the canyon to avoid the high radiation areas. You're going to need somebody to look after the place when you're gone, you know.{u}
{c16711680}And you want to be that person?
{c16711680}Me guess so. Who do that job?
{c255}Of course! Unless you plan on sticking around full-time, I'm perfect for the job. I'll work for cheap ? just a handle of caps for expenses. I don't associate with loose women, I-{u}
{c255}*sigh* I was trying to hint to you that {i}I {}could do that job, since I doubt you want to hang around here full-time.{u}
{c16711680}All right, all right. The job's yours.
{c16711680}Okay, you can do job.
{c16711680}No. Goodbye.
{c255}Thanks! You won't regret this! Check back every couple of weeks for your share of the loot.{u}
{c255}Welcome to Santiago's Trading Post, where the prices are low and the booze is strong! Heh heh. Still working on my pitch. Maybe I could interest you in something?{u}
{c16711680}Sure, show me what you have.
{c16711680}Okay, me buy things.
{c16711680}Actually, I'm here to pick up the toll money.
{c16711680}No, me here for money.
{c255}Here you go.{u}
{c255}Sorry, but you've already collected the toll. Come back in a week or so and there should be more waiting for you.{u}
{c16711680}Me buy things.
{c255}Hmmm... some of the other guys say a big fireball smacked the canyon a good one a few years back. They said it landed somewhere to the west. Could be this thing you're looking for.{u}
{c16711680}Can I ask you about the Grand Canyon?
{c16711680}Me ask about canyon?
{c255}Yeah?
{c16711680}What are you doing?
{c16711680}What you doing?
{c16711680}Stand still while I kill you.
{c16711680}Me kill you now.
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}What the fuck does it {i}look {}like we're doing? We're watching over Crimson Caravan property. Now get out here before we throw you into the canyon.
{c-16777216}
{c255}Ha ha! Hey, guys! Look at the moron! Get out of here before we smash your skull in and make you even stupider than you are now.
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Actually, {i}you're {}the trespasser. Why don't {i}you {}leave before something unfortunate happens to you?
{c16711680}Nuh-uh! Me fix! Flying box mine! You go away now!
{c16711680}Come and try it, punk.
{c16711680}Me make you dead now.
{c255}Oh, really? And who's going to make us leave? You?
{c-16777216}
{c255}Since you're a moron, I'm gonna forget what you just said. Go on, get out of here!
{c-16777216}
{c16711680}Of course me, idiot. Look into my eyes and tell me that you don't {i}believe {}I'm capable of slaughtering you and your pathetic little group if I felt like it.
{c16711680}Gah! Me tear you all apart with bare hands if you not go away {b}now!{ib}
{c16711680}No, but those old guys have a lot of young friends who are a lot tougher than you. Didn't you wonder why they just stepped aside? Their pals are going to show up any day now and kick your .
{c16711680}Okay, not me fault when you die. Old guys have lots of friends who not here right now. Soon they come back and kill you. They lots. You not lots.
{c16711680}Tell hell with diplomacy. Die!
{c16711680}No more talk! You die now!
{c255}Whoa, just calm down there. We're just following orders. We don't want any trouble, all right? See, we're leaving now.
{c-16777216}
{c255}You just threatened the wrong guy. Kill him!
{c-16777216}
{c255}You just threatened the wrong guy. Kill her!
{c-16777216}
{c255}Uh, I guess we'll just be leaving, then. Nobody said nothing about having to fight an army.
{c255}Nice try, but I think you're lying, and I don't like liars. Kill him!
{c-16777216}
{c255}Nice try, but I think you're lying, and I don't like liars. Kill her!

In exchange, he'll give me his old power armor.I wasn't able to get a GECK, but DIANA gave me a holodisk with a lot information about GECKs. Isaac might accept this instead of an actual GECK.Isaac said he didn't really expect me to find a GECK, and he accepted the GECK holodisk instead. As we agreed, he gave me his power armor.
{c255}Hello, there! I'm Isaac. We don't get many outsiders up here at Mesa Verde.
{c16711680}Hello, Isaac. You look like an outsider yourself. What's your story?
{c16711680}Hi, Isaac! How come you not painted?
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Still in one piece, I see. Good for you.
{c16711680}I wasn't able to find a GECK, but I did find a holodisk with a lot of information about GECKs.
{c16711680}What do you do here?
{c16711680}What you do here?
{c16711680}You don't look like a Cipher. Where are you from?
{c16711680}How come you not painted?
{c16711680}Maxson Bunker belongs to the Brotherhood of Steel. You're with the Brotherhood?
{c16711680}I need to get the access codes for the Brotherhood's power armor from you.
{c16711680}Power armor in Bunker not work. Need codes from you.
{c255}You're right ? I'm not originally from Mesa Verde, but this is my home now, even though I haven't gone completely{i} {}tribal.
{c255}Not a bright one, huh? Well, no matter. As for my lack of paint, it's because I'm not from Mesa Verde.
{c16711680}Where are you from originally?
{c16711680}Oh. Where you come from?
{c255}Originally, a little town way out west. More recently, Maxson Bunker.
{c16711680}Maxson Bunker? Where's that?
{c16711680}Where that?
{c16711680}Maxson Bunker? You're with the Brotherhood?
{c16711680}Bunker? Hey, you Brudderhood!
{c255}No, not any longer. We had... a difference of opinion, so I decided it was time for me to find my own way.
{c16711680}I need to get the security codes for the Brotherhood's power armor from you.
{c16711680}Power armor not work. Need codes from you.
{c16711680}What made you decide to leave?
{c16711680}Why you leave?
{c16711680}I don't suppose you've got any high tech equipment lying around?
{c255}The Brotherhood was once dedicated to preserving technology, dealing it out in small doses to those it deemed responsible enough to handle it. That all changed. 
{c16711680}What happened?
{c16711680}What happen?
{c255}I still have my own suit of power armor. At the moment, it's just collecting dust since there's little use for it around here, as you can see. 
{c16711680}I see. So, why did you leave the Brotherhood?
{c16711680}Since you're not using it, can I have your armor?
{c255}No, sorry. I may not be Brotherhood anymore, but that doesn't mean I'm going to start handing out advanced technology all over the wasteland.
{c16711680}All right. So, why did you leave the Brotherhood?
{c16711680}Well, would you consider {i}selling {}the armor, then?
{c16711680}I'll just kill you and take the armor, then.
{c255}Not for any price.
{c16711680}Right. So, why did you leave the Brotherhooid?
{c16711680}Everything has a price, Isaac, and I know there has to be something I can trade to you in exchange for the armor. What do you need? Caps? Information?
{c16711680}Oh, of course. So... where do you keep the armor? Any alarms or traps I should know about?
{c255}Spoken like a true trader of the wastes. All right, if you want the armor {i}that {}badly, bring me a GECK.
{c16711680}I have a holodisk full of information about GECKs. Will you take that instead?
{c16711680}What's that?
{c16711680}A GECK? As in a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?
{c255}It's a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. I've always wanted to study them, but they're extremely rare. I almost got my hands on one, but some tribal out west used it to create a new city before I could get to it.
{c16711680}Oh, that. I have this holodisk with information about GECKs. Will you take it instead of an actual GECK?
{c16711680}Deal. Now, what do you do around here?
{c16711680}All right, it's a deal.
{c16711680}Forget it. Goodbye.
{c255}You know about them, then? I've always wanted to study them, but they're extremely rare. I almost got my hands on one, but some tribal out west used it to create a new city before I could get to it.
{c16711680}I have this holodisk with information about GECKs. Will you take it instead of an actual GECK?
{c255}Very funny. Even if you did manage to run off with it, you still wouldn't be able to use it. It's locked down by a security code, and only I know the code.
{c16711680}Interesting. So, why did you leave the Brotherhood?
{c16711680}Good to know. Now, what do you do around here?
{c16711680}Save me the trouble of stealing it and sell it to me, then. I know there has to be something I can trade to you in exchange for the armor. What do you need? Caps? Information?
{c255}Well, I didn't really expect you to find a GECK, and a holodisk is better than nothing. We still have a deal - here's the power armor. Take care of it, and it'll take care of you.
{c255}Quite a ways to the southeast from here. I can't say how they'll receive you if you decide to go there, so be on your toes. 
{c16711680}I'll keep that in mind. So, what do you do around here?
{c16711680}Okay. What you do around here?
{c255}There were a lot of rumors going around - Brotherhood soldiers massacring civilians, stealing technology, and running weapons to Raiders. Among other things.
{c16711680}Were any of the rumors true?
{c16711680}That sound bad. It true?
{c255}Probably. I saw Brotherhood tech in the hands of people who shouldn't have had access to it, and command wasn't explaining how it got there. So, I wanted out, and here I am.
{c16711680}Did anyone else leave?
{c16711680}Other people leave, too?
{c255}A whole bunch of people, actually. All the Scribes ? Brotherhood must be really hurting from this one ? and a few of the Knights, too, I think.
{c255}Hmmm... he probably used a polymorphic encryption technique, something only a handful of the Scribes knoww anything about it. Fortunately, I'm one of them. Give me a few hours and I'll create a decryption algorithm for you.
{c16711680}[Wait.]
{c16711680}Actually, I'm familiar with that technique, too. I'll help you out ? it should cut down on the time.
{c255}All done. This holodisk has everything you need to remove the security codes.
{c16711680}What about you? Aren't you going back?
{c16711680}How come you not go back to Bunker?
{c255}No, Mesa Verde is my home now. No military chain-of-command, no drills, and no war. Besides, {i}someone{} has to keep Trig from blowing up the village.
{c255}This place is home now. It's better than the Bunker.
{c255}I live here, of course. It's nice and quiet most of the time. Now, if you're asking me about my {i}job{}, then I'd have to say it's assisting Trig with her repairs and, uh, ?inventions".
{c16711680}Something wrong with Trig's inventions?
{c16711680}Her inventions not good?
{c255}Most Ciphers are traditionalists. They build and repair electronics based on the specifications laid out by their ancestors, and {i}nothing{b} {}more. Trig is different ? she often tries to be... creative.
{c255}No, no, I didn't mean for it to sound like that. It's just that Trig's inventions don't always work out the way she intends them to.
{c16711680}What happens when she's creative?
{c16711680}What that mean?
{c255}Most of the time, nothing. Other times, explosions. Trig is imaginative, but lacks the practical knowledge to carry out her ideas. I've been teaching her some of what I know, with mixed results.
{c255}It just means that her inventions sometimes hurt people on accident. I've been trying to teach her some things which could help her, but she's still impractical at times.
{c16711680}What kind of mixed results?
{c16711680}Not understand. What you mean?
{c255}See that monstrosity by the cliff? Trig's "death cannon". It doesn't fire, and I'm afraid of what might happen if it ever does. That's what I mean.
{c255}You see that big machine by the cliff? Trig calls it her "death cannon". It doesn't work, and I'm afraid bad things will happen if it ever does work.
{c255}Well, I had considered Trig's "death cannon" as the best example of one of Trig's interesting but impractical ideas, but it looks it works after all, thanks to you.
{c16711680}Has she learned {i}anything {}from you?
{c16711680}Oh. She dumb.
{c255}Certainly. Trig knows how to build working radios now, something no Cipher has been able to do before. I'm careful not to share too much knowledge, though. Too dangerous for the Ciphers.
{c255}No, Trig is actually very, very smart. She's learned how to build many things from me, like radios. She's the first Cipher who ever knew how to do that.
{c16711680}Too dangerous?
{c255}Mesa Verde is not the place to experiment with things like high-energy equipment. Even if it was, I'm also afraid of making this village a target for every greedy warlord in the region.
{c255}Hey, you're wearing {i}my {}armor!
{c255}Is that {i}my {}armor your friend is wearing?
{c16711680}Uh, yeah. I figured that since you weren't using it, I could borrow it.
{c16711680}Yup. Me borrow it.
{c16711680}You're mistaken. I retrieved the armor from a Raider I killed. The suit only looks like yours because they're probably the same model.
{c16711680}Nuh-uh! Me kill bad guy and take it from him. This armor and your armor just look same.
{c255}Right. Well, I guess you're going to keep it, seeing as how I don't have a chance of taking it back by force.
{c16711680}No, I said I only borrowed it, and I meant it. Here, take it back.
{c16711680}Nope. Me borrow it only, not steal for good. Me give it back now.
{c16711680}Goodbye. 
{c255}Oh. Well, you're right - most power armor {i}does{} look alike. I suppose someone might have borrowed my armor to study it. Sorry about the mistake.
{c255}I'm not senile yet. That's {i}my {}armor, no mistake about it. 
{c16711680}All right, here. Take it back. 
{c16711680}Okay. Me give it back. 
{c255}It doesn't make it right that you took it without permission in the first place, but since you're giving it back, I guess I'll just have to forgive you."You'll have to do better than that.""I'll make you pay in blood.""I'm gonna rip you a new one.""Don't mess with me.""I've got a present for you.""Aiiiieeeeeeeeee!"

{c255}Welcome to our humble camp. You may rest as long as you wish, so long as you don't cause any trouble. 
{c16711680}Who are you?
{c16711680}Who you?
{c16711680}I'm not here to rest, I'm here to kill you.
{c16711680}Me not tired. Me here to kill you.
{c16711680}Goodbye.
{c255}Yes? Is there something else you need?
{c16711680}I spoke to O'Connor. He's agreed to allow the Mormons to live in Jericho, despite what you've done.
{c16711680}Sheriff say Marmets can live in town.
{c16711680}Why are you attacking Jericho's caravans?
{c16711680}Why you attack caravans?
{c16711680}Why do you have to chase away the people at Jericho? Can't you just live alongside them?
{c16711680}Um, why you not just live next to everybody at Jericho and not scare them away?
{c16711680}Prepare to die.
{c16711680}Me kill you so you die.
{c255}I'm Jeremiah, Living Prophet and leader of the Mormon church. Is there something I can do for you?
{c16711680}You can die.
{c16711680}You die.
{c255}We haven't killed anyone. We've destroyed property, yes, but we're not murderers. The water caravans feed that den of sin. We'll squeeze the town dry until they have no choice but to get off our land.
{c16711680}Your land? How is it your land?
{c16711680}They on your land?
{c16711680}Whatever. Just shut up and die.
{c16711680}You go be dead now, okay?
{c255}Our town, New Canaan, once stood on that land. It was destroyed several years ago, and now when we return to rebuild, we find these squatters on the ashes of our old home.
{c16711680}What happened to New Canaan?
{c16711680}What happen to town?
{c16711680}You're about to join New Canaan.
{c16711680}Me destroy you.
{c255}It was a beacon of morality in this forsaken wasteland. We took in lost souls, fed them, clothed them, and introduced them to God.
{c16711680}Go on.
{c16711680}You talk more.
{c16711680}Enough talk. Time for you to die.
{c16711680}Me kill you now.
{c255}The number of refugees became overwhelming, and we didn't have enough food, water, and shelter for them all. We were forced to turn many away. The situation became ugly.
{c16711680}Then what happened?
{c16711680}Then what happen?
{c16711680}No more talking. Die!
{c16711680}Me bored, so me kill you now.
{c255}A large group of men decided to {i}take {} from us what we couldn't give. They battered down our gates, overwhelmed our militia, burned our homes, and murdered our people. 
{c16711680}I see. So, why can't you just rebuild somewhere else?
{c16711680}Maybe you build town somewhere else?
{c16711680}I'm just going to kill you now, okay?
{c255}God spoke to me, and His words were {b}clear. {}We {i}must {}rebuild where Jericho now stands, and this can't happen until those sinners have been driven off. 
{c16711680}Why do they have to be chased off? Can't you just live alongside them?
{c16711680}Um, why you not just live next to everybody?
{c16711680}I'll have to kill you, then.
{c16711680}Me make you dead!
{c255}New Canaan was a pure community. Are you suggesting that we simply live alongside sin? Ignore their numerous transgressions against God? 
{c16711680}Consider it a challenge. Think about it - all those sinners, just {i}waiting {}to hear the word of God and be shown the error of their ways.
{c16711680}Um... yeah? No more fighting, everybody happy. Maybe you teach them how to be Marmets, too.
{c16711680}Forget it. Just die.
{c16711680}No more talking. Me kill you.
{c255}What you say makes sense, but will O'Connor allow us to live in Jericho? My men and I destroyed several caravans, and O'Connor does not seem to be a forgiving man.
{c255}God works in mysterious ways, and it was the simplest of His children who pointed out a solution for me. Please, tell O'Connor that we {i}Mormons {}are sorry, and that we would like a place in Jericho.
{c16711680}I'll go talk to him about it. Goodbye.
{c16711680}Me go talk to him, say Marmets good guys. Goodbye.
{c255}I'd sooner invite the Devil himself to dinner rather than permit a whorehouse to stand in the same town as a Mormon church. Enough of this. Leave!
{c255}Your heart is in the right place, my friend, but you simply can't see the situation like I can. Enough ? I won't talk about this anymore.

Once that's fixed, the central computer can activate the life support program.Frank complained that the generator that runs the life support system is running at low power, but that it's locked behind a door. Apparently, if I take some tools from the storage room, I can unlock the door and repair it myself.After complaining about numerous other things, Frank told me that the vault's resident floating eye bot was damaged and lying in the Overseer's room. The eye bot supposedly is capable of repairing the generator, though I would have to unlock the door myself.I managed to turn the life support on after the generator got fixed. It really wasn't that hard...The generator is now up and running. No more black smoke and possibly no more complaints from Frank.The eye bot was pretty badly damaged when I found it, but after repairing its motivator, it seemed just fine.Me meet computer machine name Zax-29.I met an artificial intelligence by the name of Zax-29.Me ask Zax-29 who boss of Twin Mothers.
