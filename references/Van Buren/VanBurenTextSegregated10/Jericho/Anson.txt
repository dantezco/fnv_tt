{c255}Someone's been stealing from the bar at night. Hang around and see if you can catch the thief, or "investigate" other peoples' stuff to see if they have any of {i}my {}stuff.

{c16711680}You gimme money?
{c255}I'll let you choose from my drugs: one package of Mentats, Buffout, or Afterburner Gum.

{c16711680}The thief could be carrying a really big knife, so I'd like to choose two drugs.
{c16711680}Me want more. Maybe thief have big sharp pointy thing. Gimme two!
{c16711680}A person with my skill should get all three packages as compensation.

{c255}No, I think {i}one {}package should be enough of a reward. These drugs aren't cheap, you know.
{c255}I suppose there could be some danger involved. All right ? you get to pick two, {i}when {}the job is done.
{c255}Okay, you'll get all three, but you'd better be as good as you say and get the job done quick.
{c16711680}Deal. Before I go, show me what you have for sale.
