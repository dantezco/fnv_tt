\section{THE WORLD}

Well, now you know a bit more about individuals of this world, or at least how to be one. Next step is to learn about the places in this world, and its tribes. We'll start with the latter.

\subsection{Factions}

The bombs destroyed most things, killed a lot of people, but not all. And, wherever people survive, the similar will join up in tribes. These are the tribes of the Mojave:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{New California Republic (NCR):} the NCR is an ever-expanding that started in the town of Shady Sands, in New California. Their political structure is very similar to the old USA, with a president, congress, corruption and inefficiency. Although very successful in their expansionist campaign, the Mojave seems to be where they are spread thinnest, and people noticed. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Rangers:} an elite force within the NCR Army, handpicked from the standard infantry from the best, focusing on combat and infiltration. Originally a group of hardy survivalists from Nevada, they unified with the NCR Army after the signing of the Ranger Unification Treaty in 2281 to fight Caesar's army
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{The Strip:} the Strip is the most luxurious area in New Vegas. The only entrance is through Freeside, by having 2000 caps (no need to pay, just need to have the money to spend), a passaport, or by being a member in good standing of the NCR, as NCR personnel frequent the Strip during downtime. The Strip has four casinos, each with their own group:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Chairmen (The Tops):} the Chairmen are a faction self-styled after the old Vegas, and the hippest cats around, dig? As in ``no finks allowed''. Civilized by Mr. House, they used to be a tribe known as the Mojave Boot-Riders, but now are the former most important faction in New Vegas, position they lost when their former leader, Benny, got what was coming to him for shooting Courier Six in the head. Currently, their main goal is to get back to the top, without crossing the Securitrons
	\item \textbf{Omertas (Gomorrah):} a faction that follows the best traditions of the \textit{cosa nostra}, the Omertas are a faction that, although lacking the italian accent, very much follow the old \textit{mafioso} traditions. Five years ago, their leaders were killed by the current leader, Cachino, and the Courier Six. This happened after Courier Six uncovered a plot for a hostile takeover of the Strip by the former leadership, aided by Caesar's Legion. Since then, the Omertas have been very quiet. Maybe too quiet...
	\item \textbf{White Glove Society (Ultra-Luxe):} previously ran by a mysterious group that who wore gloves, fancy porcelain masks and \textit{haute couture} clothing, the truth was that most of their members were cannibals. Courier Six and Yes Man cleaned the house up, and now there is zero human meat consumption on the premises, or so it seems. Very little is known about its current staff
	\item \textbf{Securitrons (Lucky 38):} for many years, nobody entered the Lucky 38. That is, until 2281, when Courier Six was invited by the very owner, Mr. House. However, the hospitality was paid with a bullet from Maria, Benny's 9mm. Soon after, Yes Man replaced House in controlling all Securitrons, who became the staff for the Lucky 38, the most luxurious hotel-casino in the strip. Nowadays, the panoramic cocktail lounge has the best drinks, and a full reservations lists for weeks, and all is managed by Yes Man (who acts more like a ``Maybe Man'', after being reprogrammed with more autonomy), and is owned by Courier Six. Securitrons also serve as the main security force in the Strip, Freeside and Westside
	\end{itemize} 

\item \textbf{Freeside:} right next to the Strip is Freeside, New Vegas' premiere slum. One of the best places to get robbed by random thugs armed with metal pipes and planks. If getting mugged is not your thing, you can find some of everything (or so they say) at Mick and Ralhp's, blow your money on the Atomic Wrangler Casino, or get in contact with the Followers of the Apocalypse at the Old Mormon Fort
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The Kings:} the only gang that remain in Freeside, since Courier Six nixed the Van Graffs, the Kings are a group of gangbangers inspired in an old religious figure, known only as The King, which is also how their leader is called. A Kings member is easily identified by his black cowlick, peculiar speech, leather jacket, white t-shirt and jeans. Along with the Securitrons, they keep Freeside safe, holding considerable influence on local events
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Raiders:} Raiders are gangs of marauders that roam the Mojave wasteland, attacking those that seem more vulnerable. They tend to use melee weapons or low-grade guns
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fiends:} maybe some of the worst the Mojave has to offer, the Fiends are junkies that think about little more than raiding and using chems, and who respect only brute force. They used to buy mostly from the Khans, but are currently becoming more and more desperate looking for a steady flow, since the Khans have mostly turned inwards. They use regular clothes, raider armors and helmets made from the skulls of animals
	\item \textbf{Jackals:} strong competitors for the title of worst the Mojave has to offer, the Jackals are not addicted to chems, but they are almost entirely cannibalistic. They are originated from Vault 15, in New California, though rarely they have the characteristic Pip Boy. Their group leaders tend to wear Metal Armor, distinguishing themselves in a crowd
	\item \textbf{Scorpions:} a minor gang, they are a leaderless band of raiders that mostly live from attacks attacking caravans, and usually getting their asses handed to them by Fiends. They almost always wear mercenary cruises
	\item \textbf{Vipers:} a rarer sight than the other gangs mentioned, the Vipers used to be more shamanistic. Also originated from Vault 15, the Vipers were nearly exterminated by the Khans, and today exist only in minor pockets throught the Mojave, dealing drugs and dreaming of better days
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Followers of the Apocalypse:} unlike most other factions, the Followers of the Apocalypse do not impose themselves by strength, but instead they are a force for helping all those in need, although they usually make a healthy exception for raiders. Composed mostly by intellectuals, the Followers have, among their ranks, physicians, chemists, and engineers. Every once in a while, some more combat-capable people end up attached to them, and are begrudgingly accepted as a necessary part of life in the Mojave

\item \textbf{Great Khans:} although they are a raider tribe, it would be foolish to mix them with the likes of the Fiends or the Jackals. The Great Khans base their entire culture on what literature they could find about the Mongolian empire, with a great emphasis on warrior's honor. The Khans make a living mostly by supplying drugs for most of the Mojave. Currently, the tribe is focused inwards, working alongside the Followers of the Apocalypse to restore themselves to their former glory. However, the Massacre of Bitter Springs is not forgiven, nor forgotten

\item \textbf{Brotherhood of Steel:} the Brotherhood of Steel is a military-religious organization that see themselves as annointed with the task of gathering technology, regulating its use and keeping it from the rest of the world. Once isolationists, the New Vegas chapter of the organization opened its doors to work with the NCR on the Battle of Hoover Dam, though they still refuse to share their tech, and since then they help patrol the Mojave, staying mostly near their secret base around Sloan, Novac, Primm and Goodpsprings 

\item \textbf{Caesar's Legion Remnants:} previously a large and arrogant army, the Battle of Hoover Dam left Caesar's Legion a shadow of their former selves. Most of the survivors from the Battle of Hoover Dam were imprisioned by the NCR on NCR Correctional Facility. Many deserters have retreated to Cottonwood Cove, where they live in total isolation

\item \textbf{Boomers:} Boomers are the former occupants of Vault 34, where divergences were solved with weapons. After a riot where most of the vault was destroyed, Boomers moved to Nellis Air Base, where they lived in isolation from those they called ``savages'' until Courier Six showed up at their doorstep and began a reintegration process. Currently, Boomers still view most of the ``savages'' with disdain, they have a good relationship with the NCR military, with some Boomers taking positions in the army, and a training program where select officers spend some time living among Boomers

\item \textbf{Black Mountain Clan:} once known as ``State of Utobitha'', after its ruler, Tabitha, the Black Mountain is a heavily irradiated area the once housed a satellite array. After Tabitha resumed her voyages, a supermutant named Marcus took over leadership over his peers that didn't want to go to Jacobstown. Marcus strives to estabilish diplomatic relations with humans, although that is not always possible

\item \textbf{Jacobstown:} a little town estabilished on what once was a luxury mountainside hotel, Jacobstown is where supermutants go to live in peace, and especially where nightkins go to receive help from the problems that the abuse of Stealth Boys cause. They are self-sufficient and segregationists, although that is not violently enforced, but both humans and supermutants seem happy to remain that way

\item \textbf{Powder Gangers:} a group of prisioners that took over NCR Correctional Facility, the Powder Gangers are easily identified by their clothes, typical dressing for the prision staff, and their predilection for explosive weapons, especially dynamite sticks and grenade launchers, and also low-grade guns like 9mm pistols and varmint rifles. Most of them were dizimated by the coordinated action of the NCR with Courier Six (mostly it was Courier Six)
	
\item \textbf{Westside:} in the old days, Westside was a slum that made Freeside look and feel like The Tops. However, its residents were resourceful and self-sufficient, vastly improving conditions on the neighborhood, especially since Courier Six solved the Fiends problems that plagued them
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Westide Militia:} citizens dedicated to protecting Westside, who have courage and stubborness that compensate for their lack of training. Nowadays, they are financed by The Thorn, who supply them with Sniper Rifles and 10mm pistols
	
	\item \textbf{The Thorn:} once an underground arena, where wastelanders put their mettle to the test by engaging in 1 on 1 combat against the wastelands many beasts, they have expanded their business to include an underground casino, which quickly is allowing Westside to become a veritable power on the Mojave
	\end{itemize} 

\item \textbf{Searchlight Ghouls:} once members of the Bright Brotherhood, a cult of ghouls that dreamed of flying rockets to undertake ``The Great Journey''. After surviving the crash landing, they walked the Mojave for a long time, until they reached the town of Searchlight. The radiation from the Searchlight Disaster made the town a comfortable environment for them, also being intolerable for non-ghouls, which allowed them to live in relative peace. Perhaps, a little too much peace, even...

\item \textbf{Cities:} for the purposes of reputation, each city counts as its own individual faction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Main Cities and Settlements}

The Mojave is a large place, and though it has met great destruction and much death, humans still thrive in these places:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Strip:} the Strip is the heart of New Vegas, though to access this heart, one needs caps. A lot of caps. To be left through by the three Securitrons that guide its only access, a person must have over 2000 caps in their possession (it's not an entry fee, just a verification of wealth) or a passport. Having gone through the door, one is greeted by a long street where only the more affluent, and NCR soldiers, circulate, under the watchful eyes of Protectrons. Besides all the best casinos in Vegas, it's where are located the NCR embassy, Vault 21, and the train that runs between The Strip and Camp McCarran. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The Casinos:} all four casinos share much in common: blackjack tables, slots, luxury rooms, and a proihibiton of carrying arms inside (although sneaky patrons tend to overlook this rule). The main differences are \textit{décor} and main attraction. 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Gomorrah:} home of the Brimstone, the den of the best vices in New Vegas and managed by the Omertas, Gomorrah puts the ``sin'' back in ``casinos''. It's main attraction is the strip club, the Brimstone. After the failed alliance with Caesar's Legion, they saw a notable decrease in attendance, since practically all NCR soldiers started boycotting the establishment.
		\item \textbf{The Ultra-Luxe:} home to the Gourmand, the best and most exclusive restaurant in New Vegas, and the only place where you can find premium beef outside of Shady Sands. Even faced with heavy competition from the Lucky 38, they can still claim to be the most luxurious installation on the Mojave. And that is a matter of honor, more important than life itself for some of the White Masks.
		\item \textbf{The Tops:} home of t7he best showhouse in New Vegas, the Aces Theater, The Tops is a luxurious place. Once considered the best casino of Vegas, it is managed by the Chairmen, a former tribe styled after the cool casino mafia from the past, with nice suits but also a good right hook. The Tops has the best showhouse around, with such cool acts as the musician Lonesome Drifter and the ghoul comedian Hadrian.
		\item \textbf{Lucky 38:} the most luxurious casino on New Vegas, with a 360 degrees panoramic cocktail lounge that allows its patrons to have a full view of the Mojave, 24 hours per day. The whole staff is composed by reprogrammed Securitrons, which makes it the safest casino of all, with a staff available at all times. It's managed by the Yes Man, on behalf of its owner, The Courier.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Freeside:} the poor neighborhood that surrounds the Strip, Freeside has a lot of rundown buildings used as shelter by it's inhabitants. A single pipe supplies water for everyone, and a member of the Kings is tasked with keeping distribution reasonable. Home to Mick and Ralph's, a shop where you can find almost anything, for the right price. Finally, it was also where the energy gun store Van Graff was located, before the Courier killed all of them for crimes that were never fully judged.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Atomic Wrangler:} the best casino outside the strip, the Atomic Wrangler is a rundown joint that has musicians, blackjack, hookers. They sell high quality drugs, though, due to their impressive labs, created and supplied by the Followers of the Apocalypse.
	\item \textbf{The King's:} an old religious temple, The King's School of Impersonation still holds relics from the deity of its time, a man known only as the King. This ancient religion inspires the gang that currently occupies the building, the Kings, who follow in the King's image and mannerisms.
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Westside:} while at first glance, Westside appears to be as rundown as Freeside, the main difference is that this community is self-sufficient in production of basic resources, like food, weapons and medicine, though their main source of water is ``diverting'' it from the NCR in secret (so don't go telling anyone, especially if they wear military uniform). Westside counts on its own security forces, the Westside Militia, who patrol the settlement and surrounding area, being quite efficient in keeping raiders out. After The Courier split electricity distribution evenly across all of New Vegas, things even got a bit better than they already were, though Westsiders only know of their benefactor by rumours.

\item \textbf{Old Mormon Fort:} an old fortress in the middle of Freeside occupied by the Followers of the Apocalypse, the Old Mormon Fort has two towers that serve as quarters for the Followers. Inside its yard are laid several tents, as well as the foundations of a new hospital being built from the money the Followers made by keeping the distillery in the Atomic Wrangler in working condition.

\item \textbf{Goodsprings:} a western small town, it has a few still inhabitable houses, a general store, a Doctor's house and a saloon. It is also the famous as the place where the Courier was brought back from the dead. This has caused the town to receive many visitors, among them sickly people looking to be saved just like the Courier was.

\item \textbf{Primm:} a small town a few kilometers south of Goodsprings, it is home of Vicky and Vance Casino, which is not as big or as glamurous as the ones on the Strip, or even Freeside, but, well, it's there. In the main area, some memorabilia of their namesake is on display. Other attraction, if it could be called that, is The Bison Steve Hotel, which is somewhat operational, and El Diablo, the meanest, largest and only roller coaster on the Mojave. It obviously doesn't work. Primm's main authority is Primm Slim, a Protectron sheriff wearing cowboy boots and hat, more powerful than its silly appearance lets on.

\item \textbf{Novac:} a huge, somewhat cartoonish dinosaur, holding an also very large termometer can be seen from very far away, in all directions. That's Dinky, the T-Rex\textsuperscript{TM\textregistered}, and the town is Novac. Now you know what's most important about Novac. Inside Dinky's body, you'll find the Dino Bite Gift Shop\textsuperscript{TM\textregistered}, only place to buy legitimate Dinky miniatures and glow-in-the-dark rocket miniatures (filled with \textbf{absolutely safe} Isotope-239). Close to Dinky it the Dino Dee-lite Motel\textsuperscript{TM\textregistered}, the coziest dinosaur-named accomodations anywhere in the Mojave. Apart from that, one can find No-Bark Noonan, a crazy old man that roams the streets, Ada Strauss's first aid facility, some farming houses, the REPCONN Test Site to the west, Old Lady Gibson's Scrapyard to the north and Nelson to the east. 

\item \textbf{Hidden Valley:} located to the southeast of Sloan, norteast of the NCR Correctional Facility, \textit{oh shit, pretend you didn't read that} \textbf{Hidden somewhere in the Mojave Desert lies the Hidden Valley}, a fenced area home to numerous scorpions, and where one can find the bunker where the Brotherhood of Steel keeps its base, from where they patrol the surrounding region (which's location you're not sure, because the valley is hidden and no one told you where to find it). Every night, mighty sandstorms plague the Valley, and some theorize that it might have something to do with the numerous mighty fans hidden in the valley.

\item \textbf{Nipton:} a desert town, destroyed by Legion during their heyday to serve as an example to all who would dare cross the powerful Caesar and his, uh, legions, the town lies deserted, left to the radscorpions and cazadores, or at least that's what it seems, but no one bothers to go and check to make sure.

\item \textbf{Cottonwood Cove:} located by the Colorado River, far south from the Hoover Dam, the Cottonwood Cove is a radioactive location where the Legion used as its main base outside of the Fort. Folks tell that one day, the Courier liberated their slaves and irradiated the whole area somehow. Folks also tell about Legion ghouls still roaming the place, so, you might not want to put much stock in what folks tell.

\item \textbf{NCR Correctional Facility:} a mighty prison in the middle of the desert, certainly not close to any sort of hidden valleys, the NCRCF is currently the place where criminals captured by the NCR or by the Courier's Securitrons end up. Mighty walls with barbed wire and guard towers surrounding the place, and the neverending vigilance of Securitrons and NCR staff keeps everyone under control. The stories about the Powder Ganger massacre from just a few years ago also reminds people of the futility of trying to escape.

\item \textbf{Camp McCarran:}  a pre-war airport, currently the main base of the NCR on New Vegas. Surrounded by huge concrete walls, it's a secure location that houses NCR's supplies, equipment, most of the non-fighting personnel and command, as well as training facilities.

\item \textbf{Nellis Air Force Base:} formerly a base for the USAF, Nellis has been home to the Boomers for over 50 years. Self-sufficient, it bolstered their beliefs of superiority over other inhabitants of the Mojave. It has it's own solar panels array, farming sector, hangar, farming facilities, schools, even a museum dedicated to Boomer history and a biodiesel refinery. 

\item \textbf{Jacobstown:} what was once a resort hotel for the rich and famous, removed from the Strip and amidst the mountains to the northwest, now is home to supermutants and especially nightkin, where the latter are encouraged to abandon their addiction to stealth boys. Under the leadership of Marcus, a supermutant that fought in the Master's army long ago, the mutants live in peace, raising brahmin and trying to stay out of the Mojave's problems. The settlement is fortified with heavy fencing, both due to the presence of predators like night stalkers. After the closing of Black Mountain, it's the only known refuge for mutants in the region.

\item \textbf{New Vegas Sewers:} a veritable maze of tunnels under the main Vegas settlements, the Strip, Freeside and Westside, and their surroundings, the sewers house giant rats, feral ghouls, and also the Thorn, the fighting arena in the region. Some claim that animals bred by the Thorn that have escaped still live underground, and that could be from giant mantises to deathclaws.

\item \textbf{The One:} rumor has it that somewhere out in the Mojave lies one of the atomic bombs from the great war, undetonated. Those who have seen it, or who know about it, call it ``The One''. Usually there are some Nightkin and/or Supermutants around it, basking in its warm glow.

\item \textbf{Bitter Springs:} before the Legion's arrival, this was the place of the infamous Bitter Spring Massacre. After, it became an NCR camp for refugee's from settlements attacked by the Legion. Nowadays, it's a graveyard housing the dead from both campaigns, visited only by cazadores and deathclaws.

\item \textbf{Red Rock Canyon:} home of the Great Khans, it's a large canyon at the end of a looming rock corridor north of Goodsprings. Being remote and well protected, the Khans could find security enough to somewhat thrive after the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. Most of the buildings are tents, except for the house inhabited by the Papa Khan and the trailers where Jack and Diane teach and produce chems.

\item \textbf{NCR Ranger Stations:} named after the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, the six NCR stations Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo and Foxtrot provided great military advantage to the NCR during the campaign against Caesar's Legion, and now still allow the army to keep the desert mostly under vigilance and safe. They are located, respectively, near Boulder City, northeast of Lake Mead, southwest of Novac, Southwest of Hoover Dam, north of Cottonwood Grove, and west of Jacobstown. They are all composed by improvised walls, tents, a communication station and sleeping quarters. Everything a hardened ranger needs.

\item \textbf{Searchlight:} a small radioactive town, it's inhabited by the followers of Jason Bright, as well as feral ghouls and other creatures that resist radiation. Mere proximity to the town can be hazardous or even lethal due to the massive radiation levels.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vaults}

Developed by a company called Vault-Tec, a vault is a massive, underground structure where the old ways are somewhat preserved, though some house horrible experiments, the likes of which the average mind is poorly equipped to comprehend. These are the known vaults of the Mojave:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Vault 3:} formerly occupied by Fiends, until a joint attack by an NCR ranger called Bryce Anders and the Courier eliminated every inhabitant, including the leader, Motor-Runner. Left alone, after that, no one actually knows who took over it. However, it being located in the middle of Fiend territory leaves little choices for the imagination.
	
	\item \textbf{Vault 11:} infamous as one of the most monstruous vaults devised by Vault-Tec. Though there are no survivors to tell the story, evidence gathered from computer terminals throughout the Vault describe how Vault residents selected an annual sacrifice from among their members through democratic elections. This individual would serve as overseer, and at the end of their term, they were required to enter a chamber and submit to execution. Belief was that this would placate its main computer, that would spare the remaining dwellers. Currently, its empty, and the only people who survived exploring this vault are the ones that didn't go towards the end. Although there is much speculation as to what lies at its deepest recesses, only one person actually survived to it, and the Courier is not talking.
	
	\item \textbf{Vault 19:} this vault was once occupied by escaped convicts who planned to use the sulfur deposits below to become a great power in Vegas. That is, until the Courier showed up and blew the Vault to high heavens with everyone inside. It's location is a destroyed parking lot between Bonnie Springs and Whittaker farmstead, northeast of Goodsprings, though very little remains to be seen there.
	
	\item \textbf{Vault 21:} is a Vault-Tec Vault that was once hidden under Las Vegas, Nevada. When estabilishing his domain over the Strip, Mr. House won the rights to it on a game of blackjack. It has since had most of its installations covered with concrete, and the rest was converted into a hotel/casino. Like the Lucky 38, it is currently owned by the Courier. It's manager by Sarah Weintraub, who makes all the decisions, since the Courier prefers a more ``hands-off approach'' to his power over the Mojave.
	
	\item \textbf{Vault 22:} initially, it appeared to be a vault dedicated to botanical research. That description would be correct, but misleading, since spores infected and mutated it's inhabitants into hybrids of humans and pĺants. The spores still infect the air, and only wildlife and the bravest really take their chances journeying into it. The only thing to avoid more than this vault are puns about the "funghi" within.
	
	\item \textbf{Vault 24:} in \textit{Fallout: New Vegas}, this was a cut vault with no content actually assigned to it. That makes it perfect as a starting place for Vault-Dweller characters. Players are free to create and assign any experiments to it to match their characters, or the Narrator can assign whatever they need to tell their story. Also, since its location was never defined, it can be anywhere. Have to say, thanks for cutting this one, Obsidian!
	
	\item \textbf{Vault 34:} this is the birthplace of the Boomers. In this Vault, the armory was overstocked with weapons and ammunition and a gun focused culture prevailed. It was also equipped with a great number of recreational facilities, including a full-sized swimming pool, at the cost of living space. When overpopulation became a problem, part of their population moved to the desert, where they got into conflict with the natives and eventually ended up on Nellis Air Base. The rest of the occupants were killed by a radiation leak in the reactor.
	
	\item \textbf{Securitron Vault:} the securitron vault is a sealed bunker located under the weather monitoring station at The Fort, Caesar's main base of operations. It was where most of the Securitrons currently found in the Mojave were located, prior to the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. Since being activated, all Securitron have been deployed to work as security around the Strip and the rest of the Mojave. Most people think assume that this means the vault has nothing of value left, but that might not be entirely true.
\end{itemize}
