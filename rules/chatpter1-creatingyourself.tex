\section{CREATING YOURSELF}

\epigraph{\textit{Good authors, too, who once knew better words \\

Anything goes}}{\textit{Anything Goes - Cole Porter}}

The Mojave is not a safe place, that much must be clear to you. And how are you going to survive your voyages? Are you a brawler? A brainiac? A bamboozler? 

\subsection{You are S.P.E.C.I.A.L.}

You are S.P.E.C.I.A.L., as in, you are what your stats say you are. These 7 characteristics are the base of what you are, so the least you could do is know what they mean, right? And don't forget, these are scales of 1 to 10. You start with 5 in each one, and get 10 points to spread among them as makes sense to the \textit{you} you are trying to create, in addition to moving points from one stat to another (remember, the minimum value is one, and the maximum value is 10). 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strength:} do you want to carry a lot of weapons? Lift heavy rocks? Maybe your dream is to double-wield miniguns(you will likely not be able to do this, actually). All these, and more, are possibilities granted to you by investing in Strength. On the other hand, if you neglect it, you might not even be strong enough to properly wield your weapon
	
	\item \textbf{Perception:} either by seeing what's beyond sight, identifying who's around by their footsteps, smelling like an old hound dog (and I mean detecting scent, please take a shower once in a while), don't forget to invest in Perception. After all, while surprise mauling by deathclaw may not be one of the leading causes of death on the Mojave, there is no reason to risk it, either
	
	\item \textbf{Endurance:} so you want to be tougher than the toughies? Strength is good, but endurance is better. You may hit like a brick, but it's worthless if you can't take a punch, or even fight properly. You are not a supermutant (or are you?), and even if you were, you should know what you're doing
	
	\item \textbf{Charisma:} I was going to make a joke at your expense, but nah, you convinced me not to, you sweet talker you. Hey, maybe you deserve a discount on these stimpaks, eh? Just because you're so nice. You're lucky to be such a character, otherwise I might not even be talking to you
	
	\item \textbf{Intelligence:} so now you want to be smarter than the smarties? A regular wise guy, mister know-it-all, understand electronics, big words and figures out computers like they ain't no thing? Keep it up. You don't want to be a schmuck that can't figure his way out of his pants, dig?
	
	\item \textbf{Agility:} you want to be fast, kid, if you want to escape deathclaws. Also, being able to climb the flimsiest ruins in the Mojave also helps a lot. As they say, if you can't be strong, at least be fast
	
	\item \textbf{Luck:} keep in mind, you're in Vegas, so it won't hurt you to have a little luck. It may just save you in everything you do, except if what you're doing is winning too much on the cassinos. \textit{That} tends to not be very healthy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Skills}

You are your stats, but you are also your skills. Do you barter? Blow stuff up? Beat people up? There are a lot of things you can do, to different levels of proeficiency. Keep in mind, skills go from 1 to 100. And, like S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, it can be increased by bonuses, over the 100 limit.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Barter (C):} be it caps, NCR money or other, less tangible currency, that's your game. Having a high barter will help you negotiate the best price for a mini-nuke, or explain to someone why leaving you alone is the most profitable solution. Provided that that someone is not a deathclaw
	
	\item \textbf{Energy Weapons (P):} guns that go ``pew pew'' or that turn people into goo are your jam. Unlike their ``bang bang'' counterparts, they are more than point and fire, one needs to know how to regulate them properly, and keep all parts working properly
	
	\item \textbf{Explosives (P):} you like it when things go boom, and you can make them go \textit{really} boom, while being safe from all the ill efects of all those booms
	
	\item \textbf{Guns (A):} some people like lasers, some people like explosions, but you are the one who knows that a piece of metal through the head is enough to stop the toughest of foes. Provided, that is, that you are using the proper gun and ammo. And you are always using proper gun and ammo
	
	\item \textbf{Lockpick (P):} you view keys are more of a philosophical choice, instead of a practical need. As long as you have a bobby pin, no lock wil ever deter you. Of course, you could use a gun, or explosives, but why would you let people know you're coming?
	
	\item \textbf{Medicine (I):} maybe you like helping people, or maybe you just needed to patch yourself after the latest kerfuffle, but you know bones and cuts, and how to mend them, even and especially using chems
	
	\item \textbf{Melee Weapons (S):} guns are for weaklings. Your pipe, knife, sword, spear, or even a rock will take you to victory, and you will never run out of ammo for them. Just don't get cocky, kid
	
	\item \textbf{Repair (I):} you can fix your guns, you can fix your armor, you can fix your friend's machine. The only thing you can fix is the world around you. Or maybe you can?
	
	\item \textbf{Science (I):} where other people see mysteries, you see mechanisms that you can manipulate. You know how to create, change and destroy chems, robots, computers
	
	\item \textbf{Sneak (A):} wait, am I here alone explaining stuff to the air like a looney? Where are you? Hope you're not thinking of backstabb... 
	
	\item \textbf{Speech (C):} unlike me, you can talk anyone into almost anything. Wait, what did you say? Oh sorry, I agree, you can talk \textit{anyone} into \textit{anything}
	
	\item \textbf{Survival (E):} you are the person who makes medicine from plants, fire from two rocks and some twigs, and you are one of the few people who can actually turn radscorpion poison glands and a deathclaw egg in a meal fit for a king. All that in a cave that you made by yourself
	
	\item \textbf{Unarmed (E):} you don't need any weapons, since you \textit{are} the weapon. You can say that with confidence, since no one that laughs at your corniness will regret it instantly

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Races}

Humans are the most common kind of people you will meet on your voyages, but not the only ones. Some people were mutated by radiation, better known as ``ghouls''. Also, some might be supermutants, in which case you should probably run away. Unless you yourself are a supermutant too.

\subsubsection{Average humans} 

You are the default race in New Vegas, found everywhere in most major cities and settlements. There is not anything notable about you, except your belief that Humans are better than ghouls, though you might tolerate them if you stand to gain something by their presence. Supermutants, on the other hand, are instinctively scary to you. Humans usually call ghouls ``zombies'', and there is no slur for supermutant. By default, humans don't get any alterations, but your specific background might change you. There are several variations of humans, according to how and where they were raised:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Vault Dwellers:} as the name implies, you are a human raised in a Vaults, descendant of people who went into for their protection when the bombs fell. Compared to the rest of the Mojave, you tend to have odd customs. A dead giveaway of your origins is the Pip Boy in your arm, though some wastelanders may have acquired Pip Boys from one of yours that didn't survive the New Vegas' perils. Due to a more sheltered life, Vault Dwellers in general have worse physical attributes, with intellectual advantages that come with living a life with access to old world technology and education, though their specific vault background can change these or other stats
	
	\item \textbf{Raider:} you come from a culture that overvalues physical strength over intellectual prowess, a hedonistic life that does not accept feelings or dialogue. ``Might before right'' is your motto, after the years of scraps and gunfight, not to mention survival on the desert. On the other hand, the average raider tends to have precious little in terms of social and intellectual skills
	
	\item \textbf{Strip Citizen:} your life on the Strip could not be considered easy, but it's still better than in other places. The casinos are your second home, and prostitutes are basically the only interesting girls you  meet. This environment has taught you to solve your problems using either your gun, your mouth, or your dice, though not so much your muscles
	
	\item \textbf{Freesider/Westsider:} unlike your counterparts from the Strip, you have had to learn how to survive with little resources, which made you scrappier, a real fighter, but also made you harder, less trusting and less inclined to socialize with people who had better luck in life
	
	\item \textbf{NCR Soldier:} life in the army has been good to you, yes siree. Discipline and training have made you quite the combatant, armed and unarmed. Since your deployment on New Vegas, quite some hours piloting the slot machines and blackjack tables, and your time in the casinos has somewhat increased your luck. The criminal element is not exactly friendly to your presence, and unfortunately, ``criminal element'' is an apt description for a lot of people in the wastes
	
	\item \textbf{NCR Ranger:} the best of the best of the best, \textit{sir!} Your elite training makes you a living weapon, capable of dealing with large amounts of people, Nightstalkers, and some say a Veteran Ranger could even kill a Deathclaw in single-handed combat... think you could do that? However, between the your fearful reputation and your hard training, your social skills are not aas developed, and the ``criminal element'' is even less amenable to your presence
	
	\item \textbf{Follower of the Apocalypse:} from birth, you have lived around a camp and helped take care of people in need. You have used chems as medicine, sutured open wounds, and did a lot of negotiation to get the resources you need. Living mostly a pacifist's life has made you less apt in using violence, though
	
	\item \textbf{Brotherhood of Steel:} as a Brother (or Sister), you were born with electricity coursing through your veins, being trained since a youngling into combat and cutting-edge technology. However, the isolationist and supremacist culture that surrounded you from birth took its toll, and your chauvinistic tendencies towards outsiders tend to make you \textit{persona non grata} more often than not. As a bonus, you are able to wear a Power Armor without training, provided your Intelligence is 4 or more
	
	\item \textbf{Boomer:} forget about the Brotherhood of Steel, Boomers are the Mojave's greatest isolationist, chauvinist group. They are descendant of the former inhabitants of Vault 34, where all problems were solved at gunpoint. Boomers despise essentially everyone who was not from their vault, calling them ``savages''. Most of them dreamt of cleansing the Mojave from the savages, but after the Courier estabilished first contact and friendship with them, they became a bit more open, mostly developing trade relations, though once in a blue moon they would welcome a savage to live among them.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ghouls}

Though looking like they were hit with a flamethrower, ghouls are best described by the words of the best DJ in post-apocalyptia, ThreeDog: ``Sure, they may look like hideous zombies from an old monster flick, but their hearts, their souls, their tears are all very much human. You see, children, Ghouls are simply humans who've been exposed to an ungodly amount of radiation and haven't had the good fortune to die.'' 

Though a lot of you remain essentially human, other ghouls sometimes become feral, losing all capacity to communicate or develop rational thinking, becoming little more than zombies from old movies. After some time being mistreated by them, you are likely to develop some amount of prejudice against the ``smoothskins''. Most of your ghoul friends have, at least.

On the physical side, part of the damage affected your vocal cords, meaning that you developed a raspy voice. But now you don't need to eat or drink, though you can do it if you can. You regenerate health in radioactive environments, although too much, too fast, may turn you into a Glowing One, and/or even turn you feral. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Feral Ghoul:} as a feral ghoul, you will lose all your social skills, becoming little more than an animal, or perhaps little less. You don't think, you don't have goals, and you live for the next meal, forever or until someone puts you out of your misery
	\item \textbf{Glowing One:} it's hard to reach this level of ghoulification without becoming feral, but it can happen. As a Glowing One, exposure to radiation makes you stronger, and you can store radiation and release it as an energy explosion (this action costs 2 Action Points) that restores your health, as well as the health of other ghouls in your vicinity. Sometimes, you might even resurrect a fallen ghoul this way. But you can kiss goodbye your chances of walking peacefully among humans, even though some might deal with you, provided you are especially charming
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Supermutants} 

Large, green, strong, ugly and not very smart, let's hope you are not sensitive about this and, if you are, that nobody calls you that to your face. 

Supermutants are humans that were exposed to the Forced Evolution Virus (F.E.V.), and used to serve the Master, a megalomaniacal, superintelligent mutant (that suffered a different sort of mutation), and after his demise, became mostly directionless. Because supermutants are sterile, the usual way to increase their numbers is by capturing humans and exposing them to the F.E.V. (only humans, as ghouls are not affected). 

Your mutation makes you stronger, faster, and immune to radiation and diseases, but also very much less intelligent and sociable. Your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. totals also change, you get +5 to total Strength, being able to reach 15, and +10 points to Damage Threshold, but you start with 5 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points for your character. Due to their large hands, you will not be able to use most smaller weaponry, in either it's laser or gunpowder varieties, and forget about power armor, too, as they don't come in extra larger sizes. Supermutants normally ignore ghouls, though sometimes they might use them as slave labor. There are two possible variations to supermutants:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Nightkins:} you are the supermutant other supermutants aspire to be. As a nightkin, you are smarter, stronger and more resilient, but that makes you more arrogant. You get +6 to total strength, being able to reach 16, but you start with 7 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points for your character, and +15 points to Damage Threshold, reflecting your superior durability.. In terms of appearanche, your overindulgence of Stealth Boys caused your skin to become more of a purple-ish skin tone, and you tend to be severely paranoid, going into full on schizophrenia in your worst moments
	\item \textbf{Behemoths:} you are much larger, stronger, dumber and more savage than regular supermutants. Though not completely feral, behemoths are not well fitted to do much besides smashing, though they can also be very caring with someone or something for which they have affection. Your hands are too large to use most weapons, except for large blunt equipment and debris.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Races summary}

It is important to note that there are more possibilities regarding backgrounds. What if, for instance, your character works with the Followers of the Apocalypse, but as a guard? This would likely negate the downsides regarding combat skills, but also the bonuses regarding Science, Charisma and Medicine. An exhaustive list would be impossible, but hopefully these backgrounds will inspire and guide you in crafting your character.

\subsection{Putting Everything Together}

So, that's half the battle, kid, because now you know. But let's put it together in an easy to-do list, to make things easy.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The easiest way to start a character is to start with a concept. Are you human? Ghoul? Supermutant? Think about those things, they will guide you in your next steps
	\item Choose a race and apply buffs and debuffs
	\item Set all your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats to 5, then move points from one stat to another and allocate your initial extra points
	\item Select one trait from the list in Appendix \ref{app:traits}, then apply buffs and debuffs as appropriate. 
	\item Calculate stats derived from the following formulas:
	
		\begin{center}
			Carry Weigth (CW) = $150 + (Strength * 10)$ \\
			Health Points (HP) = $100 + (Endurance * 20) + ((Level - 1) * 5)$ \\
			Sequence = $1d10 + Agility$ \\
			Actions per turn = $ \lceil Agility / 2 \rceil $
		\end{center}
	
	\item Tag 3 skills, and no more than 3. 4 will not be tagged , neither will 2, except in the case that it's leading to 3. Forget about 5! Once 3 skills are tagged, the third being the last skill tagged, proceed to the last step
	\item For each Skill, use the formula below, then add 15 if it is a tagged skill

		\begin{center}
			Skill = $2 + (2 * S.P.E.C.I.A.L.) + \lceil Luck / 2 \rceil$
		\end{center}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Level Up} 

Unlike war, you're always changing. Your adventures around the Mojave will mold you, you'll become more adept at fighting, persuading, fixing things and people in more than one way. The simplest way is to use the following formula to calculate the amount of experience needed for the next level: 

\begin{center}
	Next Level(n) = $25 * (3 * n + 2) * (n - 1)$, where $n$ is the current level
\end{center}

For instance, the experience needed to reach level 10 is:

\begin{center}
	Next Level(10) = $25 * (3 * 10 + 2) * (10 - 1) = 25 * 32 * 9 = 7200$
\end{center}

When leveling up, the player gains an amount of skill points to distribute equal to the following formula:
    
\begin{center}
	Skill points = $10 + \lceil Intelligence / 2 \rceil$
\end{center}

However, this method is not exactly straightforward. Maybe it bothers you to get good at energy weapons when all you use is a minigun. A different approach is for the narrator to instead attribute points for successful use of skills, be it a constant value or dice based, and level up players as a result of one or more quests that the player undertake.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{3cm}|}
\hline
	\bfseries Difficulty & \bfseries Points (Constant) & \bfseries Points (Dice) \\
\hline
\endhead
	Very Hard & 13 & 1d20 \\
	Hard  & 9 & 1d12 \\
	Average & 6 &  1d10 \\
	Easy & 3 & 1d6 \\
	Very Easy & 2 & 1d4 \\
\hline
\hiderowcolors
\caption{Maybe you don't love dice, maybe you do. \\ We have choices for all.}
\end{longtable}

Finally, every three levels, you can choose a perk from Appendix \ref{app:perks}. Some perks can have more than one rank, that is, be chosen more than once.

\subsubsection{An Example Character - Fink}

So, let's create a sample character. Say, this cat will be a Nightkin that is pacifist whenever able, although that's not very often in the wasteland. Being a former soldier for the Master, this kid has walked a long way to reach the Mojave, so he'll start at level 8. But first things first.

Let's start with a name. Let's go with ``Fink'', because someone called him that and he didn't know what the word meant, but liked how it sounds. Next, let's make like a waiter and focus on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L.s. We start with 5 for each stat. Then let's check our bonuses, which are quite nice if I do say so myself: +4 ST, +4 EN, +3 AG, -5 CH. That means the base Nightkin has 9 ST, 5 PE, 9 EN, 1 CH (remember, minimum is 1), 5 IN, 8 AG, 5 LU. And since we already have the information handy, we can take note of our +15 DT. Then, we decide how to apply 7 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points. 

Fink will be tough, silent type (very original, ain't I?). Silent also means stealthy, at least for a Supermutant, so Fink needs agility, +2 AG. Strong means both strength and endurance, so +3 ST and +2 EN. No need to affect Perception, Charisma or Intelligence. We'll neglect Luck, but if Fink was the lucky type, he probably would not have been exposed to the FEV, dig? So, Fink ends up with 12 ST, 5 PE, 11 EN, 1 CH, 5 IN, 10 AG, 5 LU, so far.

Next, we'll choose a trait. For simplicity, let's choose Gifted, adding +1 to every S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat, but getting -2 to every skill. Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy, so that's on you, and we'll move on to sort out our calculated stats: max CW is 150 + 13 * 10, which equals 280. Max HP is 100 + 11 * 20 + (8 - 1) * 5, adding to 255. Sequence is a 1d10 roll + Agility, giving us a nice 13. Finally, actions per turn is half agility, rounded up, which is 5.

Fink is coming out nicely, isn't he? So now let's move on to skills, and tag three of them. Fink is a former soldier that has had to survive without many friends for a long, long time, so it makes sense for him to have Guns, Survival and Unarmed. 

The last two steps will not be detailed for brevity, after all, they involve all 13 skills. But don't worry, I won't leave you hanging. Let's focus on three tagged skills that would most help Fink: Speech, Sneak and Unarmed.

Speech is determined by Charisma, which is one. Not very charismatic, our big boy, meaning he has Speech equal to 2 + (2 * 1) + 3, which equals to 7. Good enough for basic communication. Sneak comes from Agility, 2 + (2 * 11) + 3, so, 27. It's a good start for level 1. Lastly but oh so very not leastly, Unarmed: 2 + (2 * 13) + 3, which means 31 Unarmed, and a punch that you would do well to avoid. Completing these calculations for the other skills is considered trivial and left as an exercise to the reader. But these values are for level 1, and since then we've gained 7 more levels, accruing a total of 12 skill points per level times 7 levels, which is 84 skill points. Sprinkle these points as you think is best.

Lastly, every three levels we gain a perk, meaning we have two perks at level 8. Since he is a survivor, we'll give him Purifier and Hunter, so he can more adequately face strong creatures, dealing more damage. So, finally, we have Fink, ready for adventure. ONWARDS!
